In this paper, I study how electoral campaigns shape the demand for partisan news and, in turn, political polarization. I construct a daily, story-level measure of slant in Spanish TV news using machine learning and Large Language Models (LLMs) and link it to high-frequency audience-meter records. I then integrate it into a structural model of news demand and supply. Leveraging exogenous news supply shocks as cost shifters to identify demand, I show that polarization in news consumption intensifies only when the electoral campaign begins, with out-party aversion dominating. Regions with more polarized media consumption also exhibit a sharper and more persistent rise in ideological polarization. Finally, I evaluate the effects of media regulation policies. Enforcing the proportional-airtime rule during campaigns has unexpected effects: it widens cross-outlet dispersion in supplied slant thus amplifying audience responses to partisan content, yielding a more polarized media landscape.

\section{Introduction}

%\begin{comment}

Political polarization has surged in recent years both in the United States and Europe \citep{Boxell2020CrossCountryTI,Reiljan2019FearAL}. This matters for democracy, as it undermines electoral accountability and erodes norms of competition and acceptance of defeat \citep{Graham2019DemocracyIA}. Information segregation is therefore especially concerning during electoral campaigns, when the selection of leaders depends on what voters learn and how issues are framed \citep{Besley2005}. A growing literature links rising polarization to news-media consumption, particularly among audiences of traditional outlets. This problem is especially salient today, in the era of AI and misinformation, when broadcast media remain the most dominant and trusted source of political information.

%Political polarization has surged in recent years in both the United States and Europe \citep{Boxell2020CrossCountryTI,Reiljan2019FearAL}. This matters for democracy because polarization can distort accountability, weaken constraints on leaders, and erode basic norms of competition and acceptance of defeat \citep{Graham2019DemocracyIA}. A growing literature links rising polarization to news media consumption. In the era of AI and missinformation, traditional media remains the most trusted and dominant source of information \citep{eurobarometer2022}, and previous works show that the steepest increases in polarization occur amongs its consumers \citep{Boxell2020CrossCountryTI}. Information segregation is therefore particularly worrying during electoral campaigns, when the selection of political leaders depends on what voters know and how it is presented \citep{Besley2005}.



This paper investigates whether and how polarization during campaigns is linked to media consumption and evaluates the effect of regulation aimed at minimizing it. To answer this, I develop and estimate a structural model of news demand and supply. I test the framework in Spain, currently Europe’s most polarized country \citep{edelman_trust_2023}. The analysis draws on a newly assembled dataset of television news.  I construct a daily, outlet-comparable slant index by applying machine learning and large language models (LLMs) to the text transcripts of each broadcast. I then match this to real-time audience-meter data on television consumption. This enables me to track which content is consumed and by how many people across outlets and over time. My main finding is that Spain’s 2023 general-election campaign triggered polarization in the demand for political news. Consistent with affective polarization, viewers reacted more strongly to uncongenial (out-party) coverage than to congenial (in-party) coverage. Furthermore, I show that the most common campaign regulation—proportional airtime across parties— would have undesirable effects, leading to a more polarized media landscape.

Two central challenges hinder the estimation of demand for news. First, constructing scalable, outlet-comparable indicators of partisan slant for hundreds of broadcast hours is intrinsically difficult. Second, even with good measures, market equilibrium creates endogeneity: outlets tailor content to viewers, and viewers gravitate toward congenial outlets, making it hard to disentangle demand from supply. The methodology developed here addresses both issues by (i) generating a high-frequency, story-level slant index comparable across channels and (ii) proposing a novel identification strategy that exploits exogenous variation in the daily news pool to distinguish audience preferences from editorial decisions.

First, to tackle the measurement problem, I construct a unique dataset that captures both the supply of and demand for political content on TV news. On the demand side, high-frequency audience-meter data overcome well-known limitations of survey evidence \citep{prior}. On the supply side, I present a self-collected dataset. I process more than 500 hours of video content and, using machine-learning techniques, 
generate text transcripts. I then apply high-dimensional clustering to split each day’s coverage into more than 20,000 stories. Finally, I use LLMs to classify each story’s political tone with respect to each political party.

I compare this index with earlier text-based measures trained on congressional speeches and with the plurality metric used by television regulators, which tracks leaders’ on-screen minutes as a proxy for balance. To build the latter, I use facial recognition on the broadcasts’ imagery to quantify leader-level screen time. Across these benchmarks, the LLM-based index is more informative: by capturing thematic framing, it uncovers political tone even when parties or politicians are not explicitly mentioned. This measure reveals strong partisan differences across outlets, while airtime-based metrics or speech-trained classifiers suggest similarity or “balanced” coverage. This ability to detect divergence makes the LLM-based index directly useful for media-plurality evaluations and for demand estimation, enabling differentiation among products that would otherwise appear to be close substitutes.


Second, to address the identification problem, I exploit exogenous shocks to the salience of political events that constrain outlets’ news production. I collect all stories distributed by the largest newswire serving these broadcasters, apply the same text-classification pipeline, and use the resulting corpus as a proxy for the daily  set of stories broadcasters can draw upon each day. I show that  when the pool of pro-right (pro-left) stories grows for exogenous reasons, right-leaning (left-leaning) channels expand  coverage accordingly. This variation identifies a structural random-coefficients model of news demand in which viewers’ preferences vary with ideology. The estimated model  allows me to test the degree of confirmation bias and, because the slant metric distinguishes both party and tone, the specific form of polarization in news consumption.


The demand estimation results show that, outside campaign periods, there is no systematic asymmetry in political-content demand between right- and left-leaning audiences. Viewers generally prefer negative political news, consistent with an entertainment-seeking type of consumption in which conflict and scandals attract more attention. During campaigns, however, affective polarization emerges: right-leaning viewers increasingly seek negative coverage of the left and more positive coverage of the right, with the mirror pattern among left-leaning viewers. A one-minute increase in positive coverage of right-wing parties yields a net gain of approximately 3,000 viewers in right-leaning regions (0.03 stdev.) from off- to on-campaign. These findings align with prior evidence on polarized news consumption during presidential campaigns in the United States \citep{Peterson2017Echo}. I further link polarization in media consumption to ideological polarization using survey data. Regions with higher media polarization also exhibit greater ideological polarization and, consistent with the media demand estimates, the campaign marks a clear trend break, escalating for nearly a year after the beginning of it. 




Given the demand estimates, I model and estimate content supply. Outlets play a differentiation game, choosing daily slant to maximize viewership, with production costs depending on the mix of stories available each day. Unobserved cost shocks create endogeneity in slant choices. Identification relies on timing: I exploit the short interval between the midday and evening newscasts. Because these editions are separated by only a few hours, differences in the content aired are driven by unexpected story arrivals in the interim, which shifts production costs without directly affecting same-day unobservables. I show that outlets adjust slant to these arrivals, with responses that are outlet-specific and shaped by the stories’ partisan orientation. The results of the cost estimation are consistent with outlets’ political positions: producing left-favoring content is costly for all channels—particularly right-leaning ones—while right-favoring content generally increases payoffs, though less so for left-leaning outlets.

Finally, I test the effectiveness of existing policy interventions aimed at promoting plurality and fighting polarization in television news. The most common campaign-period intervention in Europe to promote political plurality  is the proportional-airtime rule, which requires broadcasters to allocate coverage to political parties according to their results in previous elections. Despite its prominence, there are concerns that this measure is not adequate in practice, largely due to poor measurement and weak enforcement \citep{cage_assemblee}, but there is a lack of formal evidence on it.

To assess the impact of this regulation, I use the estimated demand and supply parameters to simulate a counterfactual in which Spanish outlets were regulated under proportional airtime during the campaign. Perhaps strikingly—and contrary to the policy’s primary goal—the result is a more polarized news landscape. The spread in  outlets’ slant positions is roughly three times larger after enforcement. The mechanism behind the change stems from the rule itself: since the regulation limits only total airtime for each party, channels adjust through slant to maintain their preferred tone positions. This highlights that airtime-based metrics—and regulations built on them—can backfire when they ignore tone, yielding higher rather than lower media polarization.

Political polarization is a major concern today. In particular, \textit{affective} polarization—growing animus between partisans—indicates that hostility has become a distinct dimension of conflict beyond policy disagreement \citep{iyengar_affective}. The United States shows the largest  increase in affective polarization among OECD countries \citep{Boxell2020CrossCountryTI}, and it is acutely present in Europe, with levels that in some cases  exceed those in the U.S. \citep{Reiljan2019FearAL}.


A growing body of literature examines the causes of this rise. A consistent finding is that polarization is tightly linked to electoral dynamics. Cross-country evidence shows that polarization intensifies during political campaigns, although this increase is short-lived after elections lose salience \citep{Hernndez2020AffectivePA}. This is especially concerning because campaign-period hostility can distort accountability and reduce willingness to accept electoral outcomes \citep{Graham2019DemocracyIA}.

A complementary line of work studies the role of media. While extensive research has examined social media as a driver of polarization \citep[see, e.g.,][]{Zhuravskaya2020,bail2018exposure}, evidence from the United States indicates that the sharpest rises occur among citizens who primarily consume traditional media such as television and newspapers \citep{Boxell2020CrossCountryTI}. This pattern may be particularly relevant in Europe, where traditional media—especially television—remains the main source of political information across age cohorts \citep{eurobarometer2022}. A key open question is whether spikes in polarization around salient political events are driven by shifts in media consumption—a question with direct implications for ongoing policy efforts to fight AI-enabled misinformation and ensure media plurality.

This paper investigates whether and how polarization during campaigns is linked to media consumption and evaluates the effect of regulation aimed at minimizing it. To answer this, I develop and estimate a structural model of news demand and supply. I test the framework in Spain, currently Europe’s most polarized country \citep{edelman_trust_2023}. The analysis draws on a newly assembled dataset of content supply and demand.

The increase is consistent with a reinforcement mechanism: already-polarized audiences further polarize their news diets during the campaign.

Old intro 29 august 2025


Political polarization has surged in both the United States and Europe over the past decade \citep{IyengarLelkesLevendusky2019Origins, Reiljan2019FearAL}, fueling worries about legislative gridlock, democratic backsliding, and even political violence. While extensive research has studied the role of social media as a driver of this trend \citep[see, e.g.,][]{Zhuravskaya2020, bail2018exposure}, evidence shows that the sharpest rises in \emph{affective} polarization—marked by animosity between opposing partisans—often occur among citizens who primarily consume traditional media such as television and newspapers \citep{Boxell2020CrossCountryTI}. This pattern is especially pronounced in Europe, where television remains the main source of political information for all age cohorts \citep{eurobarometer2022}.

Polarization rises sharply during election campaigns, when public attention intensifies and party cues become especially prominent. Recent work documents that campaigns fuel surges in affective polarization both in the US \citep{iyengar_affective} and  across countries \citep{Hernndez2020AffectivePA}. Yet, despite this recurring pattern, much less is known about whether—and to what degree—these spikes are mirrored in the way audiences actually consume news. Understanding whether polarization is reflected in how viewers select and respond to political content is crucial to diagnosing the reach and depth of polarization and to informing debates about the role of media environments in democratic societies.

This paper investigates whether and how polarization is reflected in news consumption during election campaigns. To answer this, I develop and estimate a structural model of news demand and supply. I test the framework in Spain, currently Europe’s most affectively polarized country \citep{edelman_trust_2023}. The analysis draws on a newly assembled dataset that matches prime-time TV newscasts to high-frequency audience-meter records. A key component is a daily, outlet-comparable index of partisan slant, which I construct by applying machine-learning and large language models (LLMs) to the text transcripts of each broadcast. This enables me to directly track both the supply and demand for political news across outlets and over time. My main finding is that during the 2023 general elections campaign, demand for political content became significantly more polarized, especially in the form of heightened interest in negative coverage of opposing parties.

Two central challenges hinder the estimation of demand for news. First, constructing scalable, outlet-comparable indicators of partisan slant for thousands of broadcast hours is intrinsically difficult. Second, even with good measures, market equilibrium creates endogeneity: outlets tailor content to viewers, and viewers gravitate toward congenial outlets, making it hard to disentangle demand from supply. The methodology developed here addresses both issues by (i) generating a high-frequency, story-level slant index comparable across channels, and (ii) exploiting exogenous variation in the daily news pool to distinguish audience preferences from editorial decisions.

First, to tackle the measurement problem, I construct a unique dataset that captures both the supply of and demand for political content on Spanish TV news. On the demand side, high-frequency audimeter data overcome well-known limitations of survey evidence \citep{prior}. On the supply side, I present a unique self-collected dataset of TV news. I use machine-learning techniques to process more than 500 hours of content and produce text transcripts. I then use high-dimensional clustering on the text to split each day’s coverage into more than 20,000 stories. Finally, I use LLMs to classify each story’s political tone.  This approach yields a granular, daily measure of the airtime and slant devoted to each party. I show how LLMs allow imputing slant from thematic framing, not onlt explicit mentions to parties and politicians. I validate my method against survey data on news ideology and consumption across outlets and compare it with existing text-classification methods, showing performances against earlier measures developed using congressional speeches \citep{gentzkow2008preschool, laver2003extracting}. I also apply face recognition to quantify political leaders’ screen time—the metric most TV regulators currently monitor—and illustrate its shortcomings relative to my index.

Second, to overcome the identification problem, I exploit exogenous shocks to the daily news landscape. I collect all stories distributed by the largest newswire service that feeds these outlets, apply the same text-classification method, and use the resulting corpus as a proxy for the news landscape—the set of stories broadcasters can draw upon each day. I document that, when the pool of pro-right (pro-left) stories is larger, right-leaning (left-leaning) channels expand their coverage accordingly. This exogenous variation identifies a structural model of news demand in which viewers’ preferences vary with ideology, allowing me to test the degree of confirmation bias and, because the slant metric distinguishes both party and tone, the form of polarization in news consumption.


Using these demand estimates, I model and estimate news production. Outlets play a differentiation game, choosing their daily slant to maximize viewership. Production costs depend on the mix of stories available each day, that is, on inputs drawn from the news landscape. Endogeneity arises from unobserved marginal-cost shifters. My identification strategy relies on timing: the arrival of new partisan stories between the midday and evening editions raises the share of political content, with outlet-specific responses that depend on the stories’ orientation. Assuming unobserved marginal costs are constant within a day, the variation in story arrivals between midday and evening broadcasts pins down each outlet’s slant-production costs.

The results show that, outside campaign periods, there is no systematic asymmetry in political-content demand between right- and left-leaning audiences; viewers generally prefer negative political tone. During campaigns, however, affective polarization emerges: right-leaning viewers increasingly seek negative coverage of the left and more positive coverage of the right, with the mirror pattern among left-leaning viewers. A one-minute increase in positive coverage of right-wing parties yields a net gain of approximately 3,000 viewers in right-leaning regions (0.03 stdev.) from off- to on-campaign. These findings align with prior evidence on polarized news consumption during presidential campaigns in the United States \citep{Peterson2017Echo}.

I further link polarization in media consumption to partisan polarization using survey data. Regions with higher media polarization also exhibit greater affective polarization. Furthermore, the election campaign constitutes a trend break in polarization, leading to a sharp increase in political polarization that extends to more than one year later.

The results of the cost estimation are consistent with outlets’ political positions. Producing left-favoring content is costly for all channels—particularly right-leaning ones—while right-favoring content generally increases payoffs, though less so for left-leaning outlets.

These findings raise important questions about the effectiveness of existing policy interventions aimed at promoting plurality in television news. Much of the recent policy debate on polarization has concentrated on regulating information supply, with interventions spanning efforts to combat misinformation and the amplification of fake news, particularly on digital platforms. For traditional media, however, regulation remains more limited. The main mechanism to promote political plurality on television during election periods is the proportional-airtime rule, which requires broadcasters to allocate coverage to political parties according to their performance in previous elections. Despite its prominence, there are concerns that this measure is not adequate in practice, largely due to poor measurement and weak enforcement \citep{cage_assemblee}.

To assess the impact of this regulatory approach, I use the estimated demand and supply parameters to simulate a counterfactual in which Spanish outlets were regulated under proportional airtime during the campaign. The results show that imposing such a regulation would increase polarization in media slant. The logic is simple: since the regulation limits only total airtime for each political party, channels can adjust through slant to maintain their preferred positions.

OLD INTRO 18-07-2025


Political polarization has surged in both the United States and Europe over the past decade \citep{IyengarLelkesLevendusky2019Origins,Reiljan2019FearAL}. Extensive research highlights the role of social media in driving this trend \citep{Zhuravskaya2020,bail2018exposure}. However, \citet{Boxell2020CrossCountryTI} find that polarization in the United States has increased the most precisely among groups that are more likely to consume traditional, rather than social, media. Even now, television remains the primary source of political information across Europe, and it is known to have large effects on voting outcomes \citep{dellavigna2007fox,gentzkow_turnout,martin2017}, education \citep{gentzkow2008preschool}, and culture \citep{jensen2009power}. The mechanisms through which this influence operates—specifically, the preferences driving viewer demand—remain understudied.


In response, regulators have tightened rules in media markets, but designing and evaluating effective policies remains challenging. The first obstacle is measurement: developing indicators of partisan slant that are both scalable to thousands of hours of content and comparable across outlets is inherently difficult. Second, even with good measures, there is a fundamental identification problem. Market equilibrium introduces endogeneity: the content an outlet provides is a strategic response to viewer preferences, while viewers choose outlets that align with their views. This feedback loop makes it difficult to separate viewer demand from the editorial decisions of the channels.
This paper proposes a novel methodology to address these two challenges. I estimate the extent of confirmation bias and polarization in the demand for political content and examine how these dynamics evolve during electoral campaigns in Spain, the most polarized country in Europe \citep{edelman_trust_2023}.

To tackle the measurement challenge, I construct a unique dataset that integrates the supply and demand of political content in Spanish TV news. On the demand side, high-frequency audience-meter data address well-known limitations of survey-based studies \citep{prior}. On the supply side, I compile a text corpus of all news segments and employ Large Language Models (LLMs) and machine learning to classify their political tone. This approach provides a granular, daily measure of the airtime and tone allocated to each political party. I further show how my stance measure compares with previous text-classification methods based on congressional speeches, dictionary counts, and face-recognition measures of political leaders’ screen time.

To overcome the identification problem, I propose a strategy that leverages exogenous shocks to the daily news supply. I collect all stories from the largest news aggregator that supplies these outlets, using it as a proxy for the day’s available news landscape. While outlets aim to maintain their long-term ideological positions, these daily news shocks constrain their broadcasts, making some days exogenously more favorable to one ideological side. Descriptive evidence supports this mechanism: right-wing (left-wing) channels expand coverage when the pool of favorable right-wing (left-wing) stories is larger.

My findings on the demand estimation align with prior evidence on polarized news consumption in the United States \citep{Peterson2017Echo}. Outside of campaign periods, there is no systematic asymmetry in political-content demand between right- and left-leaning audiences; viewers generally prefer negative political tone. During campaigns, however, affective polarization emerges: right-leaning viewers increasingly seek negative coverage of the left and more positive coverage of the right, with a mirror pattern among left-leaning viewers. An increase of one minute of positive coverage towards right parties in a net gain of 3000 viewers in right regions (0.03 stdev) from off to campaign periods. 


Using these demand estimates, I model and estimate news production. Outlets engage in a differentiation game, choosing daily slant to maximize viewership. Production costs depend on the mix of stories available each day. Identification relies on timing: I exploit variation in news stories between midday and evening broadcasts to identify outlets’ slant-production costs. Producing left-favoring content is costly for all channels, particularly for right-leaning ones, while right-favoring content generally increases payoffs, though less so for left-leaning outlets.


Existing media regulations to foster political plurality have often proved insufficient because of poor measurement and, consequently, lack of enforcement \citep{cage_assemblee}. I run a counterfactual in which Spain adopts a policy already used in several European countries: proportional airtime during election campaigns. I estimate the equilibrium of the game constraining outlets to devote relative political time to each party according to past election results. Consistent with the way this policy is enforced, I regulate only total airtime, allowing channels to adjust through tone.

This paper is the first effort to quantitatively monitor media slant in Spain and contributes to the debate on regulation in media markets.

\paragraph{Related Literature}


The first strand of the literature that my paper contributes to is that on the measurement of media slant. \citet{puglisi_review} divide measures of bias into the \textit{comparison}, the \textit{intensity}, and the \textit{tone} approaches. The comparison approach relies on text-analysis techniques to benchmark media slant against partisan language. \citet{milyo_measure} and \citet{gentzkow2010media} compare, respectively, citations of think tanks and linguistic similarities between U.S. newspapers and congressional speeches.

The intensity approach quantifies how much time is devoted to different issues; it has been applied to U.S. newspapers via endorsements \citep{ChiangKnight2011} and to television via airtime \citep{durante2012partisan,CageHengelHerveUrvoy2022}. This metric is also the main slant indicator used by public regulatory agencies such as ARCOM in France or Italy's Osservatorio di Pavia. I contribute to this literature by proposing a new methodology that combines tone and intensity, using LLMs to discern both sentiment and airtime. I also compare my measure with existing metrics, highlighting some of their drawbacks.

The second strand studies consumption of political information in media markets. I take a revealed-preference, structural approach. Building on \citet{gentzkow2010media}, I use text to quantify outlet slant and model heterogeneous tastes for like-minded news while also accounting for competitive behavior in the supply of information. Closely related, \citet{SimonovRao2022} estimate a structural model of demand for government-controlled online news in Russia. This paper proposes a novel framework for structural estimation of content preferences, combining LLM-based slant measures with an integrated model of demand and supply of news. I furthermore propose an identification strategy that exploits downstream production in content. News aggregators that supply news outlets can be used to exploit exogenous shocks in the overall news landscape that constrain outlet's ability to slant the news of the day.\footnote{For an alternative use of downstream aggregators as shocks in content supply see \cite{milena}.} My identification strategy can be applied in settings where previous instruments like cable-dial positions \citep{martin2017} are not applicable. 

Third, a growing body of literature studies media persuasion. Experimental evidence shows mixed conclusions: some studies find limited scope for persuasion because self-selection dominates \citep{arceneaux_johnson_2013}, whereas others document reinforcement effects among strongly committed partisans \citep{levendusky}. Other studies have shown consistent media persuasion effects on polarization attitudes; \citet{schneider2025media} show how TV coverage of immigration polarizes attitudes toward immigrants in France, and \citet{martin2017} show that cable-news polarization can account for much of the rise in U.S. voter polarization. I add to this evidence by linking media consumption to political polarization, highlighting the role of media in salient political events such as campaigns—where existing work documents consistent rises in polarization \citep{Hernndez2020AffectivePA}—but where the media’s role remains underexplored.

Fourth, this article contributes by bringing tools from IO estimation to the political economy literature. Recent work uses text embeddings and imagery to build product characteristics in demand models \citep{compiani2025demandestimationtextimage}. I leverage LLMs to construct slant-based product characteristics, capturing differentiation in goods that might otherwise seem homogeneous, such as TV news programs. However, this richer product space raises concerns about endogeneity in characteristics. Prior studies address this with instruments based on demographic shifts across pricing zones \citep{fan} or candidate positions across electoral precincts \citep{longuet-marx2025party}. However, these instruments are difficult to adapt to media environments with high-frequency data and with political slant such as mine. I instead exploit supply shocks in upstream news content, which provide exogenous variation in setups with high-frequency dynamics. On the supply side, I build on the media IO literature on spatial competition in television. Closest to my setting, \citet{Goettler2001SpatialCI} study optimal schedule choices by profit-maximizing networks; in contrast, I estimate a daily content-positioning game and introduce an identification strategy that leverages high-frequency variation to pin down cost parameters even when credible demand shocks are unavailable.

Finally, this paper contributes to the literature that evaluates policy interventions in media markets. Previous works have studied interventions aimed at reducing polarization in online media. Exposure to opposing views has been shown to increase, rather than decrease, polarization \citep{bail2018exposure}. Temporary shutdowns of social media platforms (e.g., Facebook during pre-campaign periods) have been found to modestly reduce polarization, though often at the cost of lower political knowledge \citep{Allcott2024TheEO}. Policy interventions in television markets have instead focused on market structure and ownership—for instance, bundling \citep{crawford_yurukoglu}, vertical integration \citep{crawford_vertical}, ownership changes \citep{MARTIN_McCRAIN_2019,CageHengelHerveUrvoy2022}, and entry \citep{prat_stromberg_entry}. To the best of my knowledge, this is the first paper evaluating the effectiveness of content regulations within a structural model of supply and demand for news.

\subsection*{Related Literature}


This paper contributes to several strands of the media and political-economics literature. Existing work has measured media bias through candidate endorsements \citep{ChiangKnight2011}, text-based slant \citep{gentzkow2010media,GentzkowShapiroTaddy2019}, and screen-time shares \citep{durante2012partisan,CageHengelHerveUrvoy2022}. I propose a new methodology that combines ideological tone and airtime using large language models (LLMs), allowing for a high-frequency, scalable slant measure. This approach improves on prior text-based classifications by validating against survey-based preferences and tracking tone and exposure at the story level. The result unifies previously separate approaches \citep{puglisi_review}, and by incorporating variation in the news supply chain, connects to work on bias driven by \emph{filtering} versus \emph{distortion} \citep{gentzkow2014media}.


On the demand side, I build on recent work estimating preferences for like-minded news \citep{SimonovRao2022,gentzkow2010media}. Unlike \cite{SimonovRao2022}, who treat the supply side as fixed and recover audiences’ tastes from random day-to-day swings in the overall share of government-sensitive stories, I  rely on product-level cost shifters that move each station’s slant differently within the same day. 


Past works have found significant heterogeneity in content consumption by demographic groups, as documented by \citet{gambaro2021revealed} for Italian TV markets and for US media markets \citep{bang2023, BangSieg2025}. I focus on ideological taste differences and contribute to the literature on media-driven polarization. While experimental evidence points to limited persuasion due to self-selection \citep{arceneaux_johnson_2013}, and reinforcement effects among partisans \citep{levendusky}, \citet{martin2017} show that cable-news polarization can account for much of the rise in voter polarization: using channel positions as instruments for U.S. TV consumption,. Although data limitations prevent me from modeling belief updating directly as in their work, I present correlational evidence linking media and political polarization.

Methodologically, the paper contributes to work that uses text embeddedings  and imagery to construct product characteristics in demand models \citep{compiani2025demandestimationtextimage}. I introduce a scalable index of media slant that incorporates both tone and intensity of coverage and compare it to slant measures based on facial recognition. This tool enables to account for differentiation in products that might otherwise seem homogeneous such as TV news. 

However, this richer product space raises standard concerns about endogeneity. I address this with a novel identification strategy that exploits supply shocks in news content drawn from upstream aggregators,\footnote{ A similar mechanism appears in \citet{milena}, who study how an Associated Press keyword ban altered U.S. newspaper coverage} extending instrument designs based on demographic changes over pricing zones \citep{fan,gentzkow2010media} or candidate positions across electoral precincts \citep{longuet-marx2025party}.


Finally, prior research evaluates policy interventions in television markets—bundling \citep{crawford_yurukoglu}, vertical integration \citep{crawford_vertical}, ownership changes \citep{MARTIN_McCRAIN_2019,CageHengelHerveUrvoy2022}, and entry \citep{prat_stromberg_entry}. I extend this literature by assessing content regulations aimed at enhancing political plurality.

\paragraph{Rest of the Paper}

The remainder of the paper is organized as follows. In Section \ref{sec:context}, I briefly summarize the Spanish political and TV landscape. Section \ref{sec:data} introduces the data and describes the text analysis techniques I employ, along with descriptive statistics on both the content and audience sides. In Section \ref{sec:demand}, I first describe the market setting and the demand model and then discuss the endogeneity problem and the identification strategy and  conclude the section with the results.  Section \ref{sec:supply} presents the identification and estimation of the supply-side parameters. Finally, Section \ref{sec:counter} shows the counterfactual estimation and Section \ref{sec:conclusion} concludes. 

	
	
	\section{Context}
	
Before detailing the data and text-classification methodology, I situate the study by comparing Spain with Europe and the United States along three dimensions. First, I document patterns of media use and credibility, showing that traditional media—especially television—remain the primary source of political information in Europe and in Spain. Second, I summarize the Spanish party system and describe the main national TV newscasts and the ideology of their audiences during the sample period. Third, I quantify audience sorting across outlets, benchmarking Spain’s isolation in TV, radio, and the press against recent estimates for France and the United States. This context motivates the focus on television and frames the external validity of the results.
	
	\label{sec:context}
	
		\subsection{Traditional Media and Political Information}
	
	Traditional media remain the primary source of information in most European countries \citep{europarl2024}. Figure \ref{fig:motivation2} shows the main media used to acquire political information in Europe by age group, as reported by the 2022 Eurobarometer survey under the question \textit{"What media have you used the most to access news in the past 7 days?"}. Traditional media are represented to the left of the vertical, dashed line as radio, press, and television. Television remains the dominant source of political information for those aged 50 and older and  surpasses social media across all age cohorts.
	
	This pattern is also consistent for Spain. Figure \ref{fig:motivation} shows the main media used to acquire political information in Spain by age group, as reported by the 2023 survey from the Centro de Investigaciones Sociológicas (CIS). Television is preferred to social media for all but the youngest cohort (15- 35).

		\label{fig:motivation2}
	\end{figure}
	
	
	

	
	
Traditional media still enjoy higher credibility than digital-only outlets or news encountered on social platforms. Europeans continue to cite television as their main source of current-affairs information, and nearly half (49 \%) say they trust public TV and radio—well above printed newspapers (39 \%) or news found on social networks and messaging apps (each below 15 \%) \citep{eurobarometer2022}. This credibility premium is closely linked to rising concern about fake news: respondents who worry most about disinformation are also the likeliest to turn to traditional broadcasters when verifying what is true. In the era of AI-enabled misinformation, audiences therefore continue to see traditional outlets—especially prime-time newscasts—as the safest gatekeepers of political information, highlighting the importance of analyzing these markets.

	\subsection{Spanish Politics and TV News}
	
	
	
Here, I provide context on the Spanish political party system to situate television news and the ideology of their audiences.

	
	
	
	\subsubsection*{Spanish Political Context}
	

	

	
	
	Political power in Spain has historically been dominated by a two-party system, with government alternating between the Socialist Party (PSOE) and the People’s Party (PP). During my sample period (December 2022–July 2023), Spain was governed by a PSOE-led coalition under President Pedro Sánchez, first in alliance with Unidas Podemos (UP) and, after its re-launch, SUMAR, \footnote{Relevant for this period of study is the integration of Podemos into the new party SUMAR. All classification metrics account for this transition, but throughout the text I refer to UP as either Podemos or SUMAR after its creation.} with the main opposition led by PP and the extreme-right party VOX. Although regional and independentist parties play a major role in the political environment, they are excluded from this analysis. For the remainder of the paper, parties are pooled into two blocs: right (PP and VOX) and left (PSOE and UP).
	
	
	 The extreme-right party VOX made notable gains in the May 28, 2023 regional elections, fueling speculation of a PP–VOX coalition. In response to these results, the day after the regional elections, President Sánchez decided to bring forward the general elections to July 23, 2023. In that election, the PP became the largest parliamentary group, though without the possibility of forming an absolute majority, which led  the left coalition to maintain power. 
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	\subsubsection*{Spanish TV News}
	
	
	The product analyzed in this paper is television news. I focus on the four largest national news channels: Televisión Española, the state‐owned public broadcaster; Antena 3 and La Sexta (Atresmedia group); and Telecinco (Mediaset). Altogether, their evening news editions capture around 50 \% of the market share—about 4.5 million viewers, or 10 \% of Spain’s population. By comparison, the most‐watched U.S. cable‐news program (Fox News) averages roughly 2.2 million  viewers. While these outlets drive the national news agenda, data limitations prevent inclusion of regional networks—most notably Catalonia’s TV3, which commands a substantial local audience and may exhibit distinct partisan dynamics. Future work can extend this framework to incorporate TV3 and other region‐specific channels.  
	


What does the audience of these programs look like politically?	Figure \ref{fig:opinion} shows the correlation between individuals' preferred political party (left or right) and their preferred channel for acquiring political information. I condition only on \textit{partisan} individuals, i.e., those who report a preferred political party. Right-wing individuals  tend to watch Antena 3 (A3) more, whereas left-leaning individuals are divided between La Sexta and the public channel Televisión Española (TVE). Telecinco (T5)  appears in the middle, with weak correlations. This is consistent with the Mediaset group offering more pro-entertainment content as previously documented for Italy in \citet{durante_aer}.

Survey question: ‘What is your preferred TV channel for political content?’ Source: CIS, Encuesta Pre-electoral 2023.}
		\label{fig:opinion}
	\end{figure}
	
	

	
	
	
	To benchmark the degree of partisan sorting in television news against other media and prior studies, I compute the \emph{isolation index} \citep{gentzkow_isolation} for TV, radio, and the press. In a binary left–right setting, the index measures how much more likely a right-wing user is to encounter a co-partisan in the outlets that right-wing audiences visit than a left-wing user would in the outlets left-wing audiences visit. An isolation index of zero indicates no additional clustering by ideology (i.e., right- and left-leaning viewers consume the same outlets), while an index of one corresponds to complete segregation, where each group encounters only its own members.% 
	The formal definition appears in  Section~\ref{sec:isolation}. 
	
	On television, right-wing exposure for right-wing viewers (i.e., the average right share of the outlets they watch) is 41\% compared to 30\% for left-wing viewers. 
	In the press, the figures are 43\% vs.\ 25\%, and on radio 52\% vs.\ 24\%.
	Accordingly, the index ranks television as the least isolated medium (11 pp), followed by the press (18 pp), with radio the most isolated (29 pp). Results of the isolation index its decomposition by party bloc and can be seen in  Table~\ref{tab:isolation_table}.
	
	To contextualize these results, I compare them with recent estimates for France in 2022 \citep{Dejean2022PartisanSE} and the U.S.\ in 2008 \citep{gentzkow_isolation} (Table~\ref{tab:isolation_table_compare} ). Spain exhibits higher levels of partisan isolation across all media, consistent with the high levels of political polarization documented elsewhere \citep{edelman_trust_2023}.
	Television in Spain is about 8 percentage points more isolated than  French TV and nearly 10 pp above U.S.\ broadcast TV.
	
	Taken together, the cross-country ranking reveals a common pattern: newspapers and radio are more ideologically segmented than broadcast TV, while Spain shows overall higher segregation. Since media effects are limited when audiences are already sorted, this pattern suggests greater potential for television to influence attitudes (given its comparatively mixed audience) and less for radio or newspapers, where audiences are already politically aligned. This distinction is crucial when considering the external validity of my results for other media environments.
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	\section{Data and Descriptive Evidence}
	\label{sec:data}

	I assemble a unique dataset that captures both the demand and supply sides of TV news. For the demand side, I have minute-by-minute viewership data for the four main channels that offer daily news programs: TVE, A3, La Sexta, and T5. On the content side, I build a scraping pipeline that records the daily news programs live and processes this information into text. This dataset spans from December 2022 to July 2023 on a daily basis. It is complemented by all the stories published in Spanish by the largest news provider. Finally, I make use of survey and weather data as controls.
	
		\subsection{Data}
		
			\textbf{TV Content}
		
		I record daily  videos for both the midday and evening news editions. This leads to a total of 563 hours of content. I rely on Google Cloud infrastructure to store and process the data. Videos are converted to audio, and I use machine learning (\textit{speech-to-text}) to obtain text transcripts. Although visuals are not used in the main estimation due to computational constraints, I show comparisons between image and text metrics below. A summary of the entire downloading pipeline is provided in Appendix Section \ref{sec:appendix_models}.
		
		News programs offer a unique environment to test substitutability for several reasons. Even though channels offer other political programs, the homogeneity of these products allows for very clean comparisons. These programs are broadcast every day at almost the same time and all share a very similar structure, with a presenter introducing the main stories of the day. Their lengths are similar, with the shortest show (A3) averaging 32 minutes and the longest (TVE) 42 minutes.
		
		TV news programs are also highly fact-checked and they remain the most trusted source of information in Spain.\footnote{The Digital News Report 2023 reveals notable patterns in public trust towards news media across Europe, with Spain reflecting a stable but modest level of confidence. According to the report, the public service broadcaster RTVE and A3 Noticias continue to rank as the most trusted news sources, with trust levels of 48\% and 51\%, respectively. La Sexta registers  approximately 42\%, and T5 follows at 41\% \citep{reuters_dnr_2023}.} This fact is important as it ensures a cleaner interpretation of the audience choice data as revealed preferences for the content consumed and limits the extent of fake news as an additional dimension in the editorial strategy of the outlets. 
		
	
	\textbf{Audience Data}
	
	I use Audimeter, a high-frequency audience data source provided by Kantar Media. I observe the share of viewers for each channel  each day and minute. Variation over minutes will not be exploited. Instead, I rely on the initial audience at the beginning of the shows each day (i.e., minute-zero audience).
	Although I do not have individual-level data on choices, I have geographical disaggregation for 15 autonomous regions in Spain (also referred to as regions hereinafter), which I match to survey demographics.\footnote{The Canary Islands and La Rioja are excluded due to different time zones and zero market shares, respectively. Similarly, peak days with sports events that altered the news schedule were also removed.} The shares are specific to the evening TV news shows, which, with the exception of La Sexta at 20:00, start at 21:00 daily. For this analysis, this channel’s program is treated as if it occurred simultaneously with the others.
	
	%\footnote{This might pose problems in the substitutions toward the outside option and specifically with  \textit{connected substitutes} assumption in \cite{berry2013connected}. Specifically, invertibility of demand requires weak substitutatbility across  }
	

	
	\textbf{Agencia EFE}
	
	I obtain all news stories published in Spanish by one of the largest news agencies in the world, Agencia EFE (or henceforth, EFE). I have information on the title of each story along with a short summary segment for  32,525 stories in my sample period.
	
	Similar to Reuters or Associated Press, this agency mainly sells content and images to third-party newscasts. All the outlets in my sample are clients of  EFE.\footnote{See collaborations with \href{https://www.telecinco.es/autores/agencia-efe/}{Mediaset}, \href{https://cadenaser.com/nacional/2024/09/22/el-teletexto-una-herramienta-olvidada-que-aun-perdura-en-nuestras-televisiones-cadena-ser/}{Atresmedia}, and \href{https://www.rtve.es/rtve/20130301/rtve-agencia-efe-firman-convenio-colaboracion/611440.shtml}{RTVE}.} 


	\textbf{Congress Speeches}

 I collect the complete set of plenary session transcripts from the Spanish Congress of Deputies during the XV Legislature. The official Diarios de Sesiones del Pleno are published in PDF format on the Congress website.\footnote{Available at: \url{https://www.congreso.es/es/busqueda-de-intervenciones}.} There are a total of $1411$ interventions. Each of them is linked to the corresponding speaker, and I match speakers to their parliamentary group using official records. This dataset is used for robustness of the text classification. 

	
	\textbf{Survey Data}
	
	To understand polarization behavior, I use survey data gathered from the Centro de Investigaciones Sociológicas (CIS). Specifically, I rely on the "intention to vote" question and map it onto my binary left–right spectrum according to the parties described above. These data are monthly and are in cross-sectional format.
	
	\textbf{Weather}
	
	I use meteorological data on daily rainfall deviations per region for the time span matching the TV news programs (18:00–00:00) from the Spanish Meteorological Agency (AEMET).
	

	
	
	
	\subsection{Text Classification}
	
	As noted above,  news programs present a very similar structure in length, broadcast time, and format. This homogeneity allows for cleaner comparisons as opposed to general opinion shows, where characteristics differ starkly, but at the same time makes them almost perfect substitutes; the key differentiation (aside from vertical, quality components) being the way they treat the information. Here I describe how text analysis techniques can provide robust measures of political slant and effectively differentiate the outlets' treatment of  information. 
	

	
	\subsubsection*{Building Content Characteristics}
	
	Each day \(d\), channel \(j\) produces a set of stories \(S_{jd}\) indexed by \(s\). Empirically, these segments result from BERTopic clustering on the unstructured transcripts, which ensures that the LLM has enough context by feeding it the entire text of a given story. This leads to a total of 20,674 stories. The subset of political stories, \({P}_{jd}\subseteq S_{jd}\), is the set of all stories that mention national parties or prominent politicians in addition to general words related to politics, identified by keyword matches from Table~\ref{tab:politics}.
	
	Each \(s\in {P}_{jd}\) is fed into ChatGPT and  assigned a score: \({t}(s)\in\{-1,0,1\}\)\footnote{More details about the prompt and classification results can be found in Appendix Section \ref{sec:appendix_models}.} with ${t}(s)=1$ (${t}(s)=-1$) denoting a positive (negative) tone. Stories with a stance (i.e., \({t}(s)\in\{-1,1\}\)) also receive a party label \({p}(s)\in\{L,R\}\), whereas neutral stories do not. 
	
	Notice that the broad classification of what is \emph{political} allows for stories that do not contain any specific mention of Spanish politics to have an associated slant toward some party.	Table~\ref{tab:international} contains examples of stories that lack any explicit reference to Spanish political actors yet still receive a partisan label. Positive Left stories include an economic forecast from the European Commission and the opening of a new gigafactory, while Negative Left stories include court officers barricading courthouses for pay raises and fuel-price surges driven by the Ukraine war. These cases show how the classifier infers slant from thematic framing alone, assigning a political slant to national parties without explicit references to them. 
	
	
	Additionally, a story can be mapped to its length in minutes, \( \ell(s)\) with total length of the news programs  denoted by $L_{jd}$. I then define: 
	
	
	


		\begin{equation}\label{eq:controls}
		\begin{aligned}
			x_{jd}^{party+}&= \frac{1}{L_{jd}} \sum_{s \in S_{jd}}\bigg(\mathds{1}\{t(s)=1\} \times \mathds{1}\{p(s)=party\}\times \ell(s) \bigg) &\forall party \in \{L,R\} \\
			x_{jd}^{party-}&= \frac{1}{L_{jd}} \sum_{s \in S_{jd}}\bigg( \mathds{1}\{t(s)=-1\} \times \mathds{1}\{p(s)=party\} \times \ell(s)\bigg) &\forall party \in \{L,R\} \\
			x_{jd}^{political}&=\frac{1}{L_{jd}} \sum_{s \in P_{jd}}\ell(s).
		\end{aligned}
	\end{equation} 
	

 Combining all these characteristics—i.e., party label, tone, and minutes— equation \ref{eq:controls} represents the  shares of positive and negative minutes, as well as the share of airtime devoted to politics.	Similarly, I proxy the daily news landscape with all stories published in Spanish by \emph{ EFE}—$N\approx32{,}000$ items over the sample. Mirroring the content covariates in~\eqref{eq:controls}, I classify every  story with the same NLP pipeline and construct daily measures of the political mix in the \emph{news landscape}:
	
	\begin{equation}\label{eq:efe}
		\begin{aligned}
			z_d^{\,party+} &= \frac{1}{|\mathcal{N}_d|}\sum_{s\in \mathcal{N}_d}
			\bigl[\mathds{1}\{t(s)=1\}\,\mathds{1}\{p(s)=\textit{party}\}\bigr]
			&\forall\,\textit{party}\in\{L,R\},\\
			z_d^{\,party-} &= \frac{1}{|\mathcal{N}_d|}\sum_{s\in \mathcal{N}_d}
			\bigl[\mathds{1}\{t(s)=-1\}\,\mathds{1}\{p(s)=\textit{party}\}\bigr]
			&\forall\,\textit{party}\in\{L,R\},\\
			z_d^{\,\text{political}} &= \frac{|\mathcal{P}_d|}{|\mathcal{N}_d|}.
		\end{aligned}
	\end{equation}
	
	where now \(\mathcal{N}_d\) denotes the total number of  EFE stories on day~\(d\), and \(\mathcal{P}_d\) the subset of them classified as political under the same criteria as before.
	
	
	
		These variables will constitute the main controls and instruments for the empirical application in the next section. 
	

		\subsubsection*{Results of the Slant Classification}
	
	
	
	Figure \ref{fig:chat} plots each channel’s net average tone toward left‐ and right‐wing parties, calculated as the difference between positive and negative coverage from Equation \ref{eq:controls} over the entire sample period \footnote{Specific examples of stories with their tone classification can be seen in Appendix Table \ref{tab:examples_stories}.}. Positive (negative) values indicate a net (un)favorable tone toward a party by that outlet. La Sexta and TVE tilt strongly pro-left, T5 sits near the center with a mild leftward bias, and A3 is the only channel  with a slight pro-right balance. Perhaps strikingly, every channel exhibits a net negative tone toward the right-wing bloc, reflecting the fact that the left coalition held office throughout my sample period. As can be seen in some of the text examples in Tables \ref{tab:examples_stories} and \ref{tab:international}, the classifier interprets the passage of new laws or institutional visits as something positive for the incumbent. In practice, this meant an abundance of positive policy stories on the left and comparatively few favorable stories on the opposition, which pushes the average right-wing tone to be negative.

	To compare these supply‐side slant scores with audience ideology (demand), I assign each channel an \textit{slant index} calculated as 
	
	
	
	\begin{equation}\label{eq:ideo_index}
		\begin{aligned}
			& Slant_j \equiv \bigl(\bar{x}_j^{R+}-\bar{x}_j^{R-}\bigr)-\bigl(\bar{x}_j^{L+}-\bar{x}_j^{L-}\bigr),
		\end{aligned}
	\end{equation} 
	

and, in parallel, compute each region’s left–right position from the CIS survey correlations between party preference and channel choice shown above in Figure \ref{fig:opinion}. I then normalize both series so that the most extreme channels take values of $-1$ and $1$ to enable comparisons across the two different measures. Figure~\ref{fig:channel_ideology_lines} displays these normalized scores: panel~(a) shows outlets' positions based on viewers’ ideology, and panel~(b) based on their text‐based slant. The consistent left‐to‐right ranking and close scores in both panels confirms that the LLM‐based classification recovers the distribution of audience preferences, as one would expect in  a demand-driven market equilibrium. Below, I also show robustness of the classification and comparisons with other methodologies previously used in the literature.

	\paragraph{Robustness of the text classification.}
	
	The use of LLMs as classifiers has gained popularity in recent years for various contexts, such as the classification of political stances, and they have even been found to achieve higher accuracy scores for ideological classification compared to human annotators \citep[see, e.g.,][]{lemens,tornberg2023,Gilardi2023ChatGPTOC}. However, two main concerns arise. First, LLMs have been shown to suffer from prompt instability, producing inconsistent results across multiple runs of the same query. Second, one may question the performance of alternative text classification methods. In Appendix Section~\ref{sec:robustness}, I address these concerns. I first demonstrate that the classification remains stable under repeated queries. Second, I compare my results with previous methods used to assess slant. Specifically, methods based on similarity to congressional speeches \citep{gentzkow2010media,laver2003extracting} yield a consistent ideological ranking of the outlets. I also apply face recognition to compare the slant measure with the standard metric based on politicians’ airtime. This metric, widely used by regulatory agencies and in prior research, produces a completely different scenario, in which all channels appear more homogeneous, and it fails to predict actual slant.
	
	Taken together, these results show the robustness of LLMs for slant classification and raise concerns about the use of traditional measures—such as image-based metrics—to assess plurality. Nevertheless, empirical validation with human annotators remains advisable for future work.
	
	
	

	\subsection{Descriptive Evidence}


	\subsubsection*{TV News Consumption and the Election Campaign}

	
	
	
	I divide the sample into two periods. The \textit{off-campaign} period runs from the start of data collection (December 2022) to May 13, 2023, the date of the first publicly announced campaign for the regional elections. The \textit{campaign} period covers both the regional and general election campaigns and ends on July 23, 2023 (general election day). 
	
	
The campaign period coincided with the summer months, in which seasonality drives audience numbers down. However, salient political events typically retain audience numbers. To see these effects, 	Figure \ref{fig:audience_share} shows the time series evolution of the audience shares for each of the four channels in my sample. All outlets nearly maintain their share during the campaign: A3 moves from 17.2\% to 16.9\%, T5 from 9.4\% to 10.1\%, La Sexta from 5.6\% to 6.0\%, and TVE from 10.2\% to 10.3\%. 
	
	
		\begin{figure}[!htbp]
		\caption{TV Audience over Time}

		\includegraphics[width=150mm]{figures/tv_audience_sharev2}
		\caption*{\small \textit{Note:} The figure represents the share of audience fot the TV outlets in my sample.  Vertical, dashed lines indicate the date of the beginning of the campaign, the regional and the general elections, respectively. The shaded area represents the \textit{campaign} period considered.  All series are smoothed using a centered rolling mean with a 9-day window to reduce noise and highlight underlying trends over time.}
		\label{fig:audience_share}
	\end{figure}
	
	

This stability of the audience share numbers contrasts with seasonality. All channels lose audience levels in this period—on the order of 15–25\%—with A3 still the largest (roughly 2.2M viewers off-campaign vs. 1.7M during the campaign) and the remaining channels experience similar proportional declines (see Figure  \ref{fig:audience_total}). This  suggests that information seeking  helps outlets maintain their slice of attention even as overall viewing falls seasonally. \footnote{ Due to data limitations, I cannot benchmark these patterns against prior years to quantify the effect of the campaign per se on TV consumption. }

	
	
		\subsubsection*{Political Coverage and the Election Campaign}
		
		
	
	
	Political content rises sharply during the campaign for both TV and the newswire EFE. Figure \ref{fig:coverage} plots the share of political content over time. The dashed line is the average across the four TV channels (with a shaded band for one standard deviation) represented on the right  y-axis, and the solid black line is  EFE with the left y-axis representing the proportion of political stories on a given day. On average, TV channels devote 18\% of airtime to politics off-campaign, rising to 30\% during the campaign. For EFE, the share of political stories increases from 43\% to 51\%. Both series display similar seasonality (Pearson correlation  $r=0.59$), dipping when non-political events dominate (Christmas, Easter).

	There is, however, heterogeneity in how closely outlets follow the agency in terms of political coverage. A3 exhibits the strongest co-movement with EFE in political coverage ($r=0.67$), followed by T5 ($r=0.48$), TVE ($r=0.38$), and La Sexta ($r=0.26$). \footnote{Figure \ref{fig:political_by_channel} in the Appendix shows the time series decomposition of political coverage by outlet.}

\subsubsection*{Political Slant and the Election Campaign}


Turning to the slant index from Equation \ref{eq:ideo_index}, Figure \ref{fig:net_tone} shows the  time series for  EFE (dashed gray line) and  the main outlets. \footnote{Time series for all the outlets are shown in Appendix Figure \ref{fig:net_tone_by_channel}.} Positive (negative) values indicate coverage more favorable to the right (left).  EFE’s series is predominantly negative, indicating a systematic tilt toward the left on average.As noted earlier, this pattern largely stems from the governing left-bloc coalition, which, by holding power, receives greater visibility through coverage of official meetings, legislation, and related activities.


%Outlets co-move with the wire but in a less systematic way than the political coverage shown before. 
%The right-leaning A3 shows the strongest co-movement with EFE ($r=0.36$); the left-leaning channels TVE and La Sexta follow ($r=0.32$ and $r=0.24$, respectively), while T5,  exhibits a very small correlation ($r=0.02$). This last low value contrasts with the strong correlation shown for overall political coverage by T5. Figure highlights how the outlet presents a smoothed version of the newswire ideology especially before the campaign begins. 


\begin{figure}[!htb]
	\caption{Evolution of the Slant Index}
	\centering
	\includegraphics[width=150mm]{figures/tv_vs_efe_net_diff}
	\caption*{\small \textit{Note:} The figure represents the time series of ideological index (Eq. \ref{eq:ideo_index}) for Spanish TV evening news channels and Agencia EFE. Positive values denote pro-right coverage; negative values denote pro-left coverage. TV channels (right y-axis) are grouped into left-leaning (La Sexta, TVE) and the right-leaning (A3). EFE ideology index shown on left y-axis. All series are smoothed using a centered rolling mean with a 9-day window.}
	\label{fig:net_tone}
\end{figure}

%Finally, the figure suggests that there are swings around salient political events. For instance,  the late-May rightward swing (regional elections) is amplified by A3, and the early-March leftward dip (International Women’s Day and the failed no-confidence motion of the Right) is amplified by La~Sexta/TVE.  This motivates a closer, formal analysis of asymmetric responsiveness, which I develop in Section~\ref{sec:identification}.

There are clear structural breaks in outlets’ trends. In March 2023, the right-leaning channel A3 experienced a marked shift in its slant index, with its previously conservative orientation converging toward that of the left-leaning outlets. This break coincided with a surge of negative stories about the right and positive coverage of the left. During this period, Spanish politics was dominated by a failed no-confidence motion initiated by the far-right party Vox, which exposed divisions on the right and left the opposition weakened. At the same time, conservative parties were on the defensive over a series of symbolic and institutional controversies—ranging from opposition to progressive laws on gender identity, euthanasia, and feminism, to accusations of obstructing judicial reform and mishandling pensions. In contrast, the governing left bloc emphasized favorable developments, including record employment figures, new housing legislation, and major industrial investments. A3 did not return to its previous level of conservatism until June, when the right’s strong performance in the May regional elections brought back the  divergence and partisan polarization between left- and right-leaning outlets.



My division of the sample treats all months prior to the start of the campaign as the baseline period. This allows me to better capture the underlying conservatism of the right-leaning channel A3. To illustrate how slant evolved across periods, I decompose tone by party in Appendix Figure \ref{fig:tone_by_party}. During the campaign, outlets adopted a common strategy: all became more negative toward the far-right party VOX and more positive toward the left-wing party SUMAR. As a result, the news landscape appeared less segregated, with outlets’ ideological positions converging modestly. Quantitatively, dispersion across channels narrowed slightly during the campaign.\footnote{Changes in outlets’ left–right positions are shown in Appendix Figure \ref{fig:change_line}. Dispersion is summarized using three complementary statistics: the cross-channel range (distance between the most right- and most left-leaning outlet), the standard deviation (spread around the mean), and the left–right bloc gap (A3 versus the average of La Sexta, TVE, and T5). The cross-channel range declined from 0.088 to 0.083, the standard deviation from 0.032 to 0.030, and the bloc gap from 0.063 to 0.051.}


%My division of the two sample  consider all  the months before the beginning of the campaign as the base period. This aims at better capturing the underlying conservativism of the right wing channel A3. To summarize how slant changes were affected in these periods, I decompose tone by each of the political parties in Appendix Figure \ref{fig:tone_by_party} for both periods.  The campaign period marked a common strategy for all the outlets: : all outlets became more negative on the extreme-right party VOX and more positive on the left-wing party SUMAR.  This resulted in less segregated news landscape: outlets’ ideological positions converge modestly during the campaign. Quantitatively, dispersion across channels narrowed slightly during the campaign \footnote{Changes in outlet's left-right positions are depicted in Appendix Figure  \ref{fig:change_line}. Dispersion is summarized using three complementary statistics. The cross-channel range measures the distance between the most right- and most left-leaning outlet. The standard deviation summarizes overall spread across outlets relative to the mean. Finally, the left–right bloc gap compares the average position of A3 (the only right-leaning outlet) with the average of the three other channels (La Sexta, TVE, and T5).  The cross-channel range declined from 0.088 to 0.083, and the standard deviation from 0.032 to 0.030. Likewise, the left–right bloc gap (A3 versus the other three channels) fell from 0.063 to 0.051. }


%During the campaign, all outlets—including the newswire EFE—shifted in the same direction on two tone categories: negative-left coverage declined while negative-right coverage increased (Table \ref{tab:political_sentiment_types}). Furthermore, 




\begin{comment}
	content...

Research finds that attacks intensify during campaigns \citep{lau2009negative}, while news outlets propagate and magnify them \citep{iyengar_affective}, leading to more polarized news content.  In my setting, however, the opposite happens: the political spectrum becomes more homogeneous.   Figure \ref{fig:change_line} illustrates the movement from dots (off-campaign) to crosses (campaign). The newswire EFE (not shown in the figure) moved toward the right, shifting from –0.17 to –0.13. This movement was mirrored only by the publicly owned channel TVE, which repositioned toward the center, whereas all other outlets shifted to the left.\footnote{Average relative tone by period is shown in Appendix Figure \ref{fig:tone2}.}

	\section{Demand for News}	\label{sec:demand}

In this section, I introduce the market setting for demand. Supply will be explicitly modeled in Section \ref{sec:supply}. I first develop a mixed logit (BLP) model \citep{berry_blp} where individuals choose the channel to watch depending on the content characteristic offered by the outlets (i.e., political slant). I then describe the endogeneity problem that arises from the simultaneity in editorial decisions and viewers choices and introduce my identification strategy. Finally, I present the main estimation results and evidence linking media polarization to political polarization. 

	\subsection{Demand Model}




Newscasts carry no advertising, so I abstract from two-sided market considerations. Channels differentiate primarily by how they present the day’s stories. Viewers choose one outlet to consume the news or the outside option; modeled as not consuming news in any of the outlets in my sample. The single-product choice assumption might be particularly strong in television markets, where viewers can switch programming during the same day—something that cannot be identified from daily, aggregate data. To mitigate this concern, I restrict attention to the initial (i.e., minute-0) audience each day. \footnote{Previous works have documented the importance of inertia from previous shows in TV news consumption \citep{richter2025structural}. During my sample period, there were no changes in the preceding slot's programming agenda, which minimizes this concern. Results are robust to the estimation using the first five minutes of the shows. }.



	An individual $ i $  in region $r$ chooses an outlet $ j \in \mathcal{J}\equiv \{La \ Sexta,TVE,T5,A3\}$  to watch at the beginning of day $d$ based on the following expected utility : 
	
	
	\begin{equation}\label{eq:utility}
		\begin{aligned}
			& U_{ijrd}= \underbrace{\sum_k x_{jd-1}^k\beta^k+w_{rd}   \gamma  +  \xi_{jrd}}_{\delta_{jrd}}  + \underbrace{  \sum_k x_{jd-1}^k \Big( \sigma^k \nu_{ird}^k  + \pi^ky_{irm} \Big)}_{\mu_{ijrd}}+\epsilon_{ijrd} 
		\end{aligned}
	\end{equation} 
	
	where $ x_{jd}^k $ represents the  proportion of time on channel $ j $ and day $ d$ devoted to characteristic $ k \in \{R+,R-,L+,L-,political\}$ as defined in Eq. \ref{eq:controls}. $w_{rd}$ measures the precipitation level on a given day-region. Weather conditions alter the value of the outside option and make viewers more prone to engage in indoor activities like TV consumption \citep{wilbur}. In my model, this happens with a common shift in the valuation of the inside options. 
	
	I model the distribution of viewers' content taste parameters using the standard normal random shocks $ \nu_{ird}^k \sim N(0,1)$ with mean shifted by  demographics, $ y_{irm} $, that represent whether individual $i$ in region $r$ is right-wing in month $m$ according to survey data.	The parameters $\pi^k$ allow for asymmetric tastes of politics based on ideology. Thus, they capture polarization in news consumption: More right-wing individuals might screen out opposed content. 

The unobserved (to the econometrician) product characteristics are decomposed into $\xi_{jrd}= \xi_j + \xi_{dow} + \Delta \xi_{jrd}$, where I include product dummies that account for unobserved quality factors and day of the week dummies to control for  seasonal variation in the value of TV consumption. Unobserved product tastes can take the form of higher valuation of a given type of story that comes from knowledge of it through social media, specific regional taste shocks due to local events, non-controlled amplification due to visuals and appearance, etc. By assumption, both the outlets and the viewers have full information about all the product characteristics. Due to timing differences, this assumption comes in the form of a correct expectation formation for next day unobserved preferences $ \xi_{jrd+1}$ in the moment of setting today's content $\bm{x_{jd}}$. 
	
	The outside option is modeled in terms of \textit{potential} audience  \citep{berry1994estimating} and its mean utility value is normalized to 0 .
	
	Market shares are just the integral over the individual choice indicators from \ref{eq:utility}:  
	
	
	\begin{equation}\label{eq:shares}
	\begin{aligned}
		& s_{jrd} = \int d_{ijrd}(\bm{\delta_{rd}},\bm{\mu_{ird}})d\bm{\mu}_{ird}d\bm{\epsilon}_{ird}
	\end{aligned} 
\end{equation} 
	
	where $d_{ijrd}$ equals $1$ if $U_{ijrd}>U_{ikrd} \quad \forall j\neq k$ and $0$ otherwise. Survey weights are included in the integration.\footnote{The model is estimated using the \textit{pyblp} package \citep{conlon2020best}.} 

Under the assumption of no individual heterogeneity in preferences  ($\bm{\sigma}=0$) nor in  the distribution of ideology in a given region ($y_{ir}= \bar{y_r}$),  equation \ref{eq:utility} is consistent with a plain logit model as:


\begin{equation}\label{eq:logit}
	\begin{aligned}
		& ln \left(\frac{s_{jrd}}{s_{0rd}}\right)= \sum_k x_{jd-1}^k\beta^k+w_{rd}   \gamma  +\sum_k \left(x_{jd-1}^k\times y_r \right) \phi^k +  \xi_{jrd}
	\end{aligned} 
\end{equation} 


I show results under both the BLP and  logit models in  Section \ref{sec:results}. 
	
	\subsection{Endogeneity and Identification Strategy} \label{sec:endogeneity}
	\label{sec:identification}
	Models of demand estimation have often treated product characteristics as exogenous and used them as instruments for estimating price elasticities. While this might be true in markets where characteristics are costly to change and competition relies mainly on price after products are launched, content exogeneity is not credible in my setup: channels  tilt the day's slant according to their audiences' preferences.
	
	Formally, viewers form expectations about each channel’s utility based on exogenous variables—weather, individual attributes, and an unobserved (to the econometrician) shock~$\xi$—as well as yesterday’s content slant~$\bm{x}_{jd}$. Channels, in turn, choose today’s slant while forecasting tomorrow’s utility shock~$\Delta\xi_{j,d+1}$. Hence, their optimal content decisions are functions of unobserved taste shocks, implying $\E[\mathbf{x}_{jrd}\,\Delta\xi_{jrd+1}] \neq \mathbf{0}$.
	
	To overcome this problem, I instrument every endogenous product characteristic~$k$ with exogenous supply shocks. Television stations rely heavily on third-party wire services for footage, text, and images, a downstream flow documented and exploited for U.S. newspapers in earlier work \citep{milena}. The fact that all outlets in my sample contract with EFE mitigates concerns that the agency is systematically biased or poorly informed. The goal, therefore, is not to proxy the outlet-specific news landscape perfectly but to exploit variation across days in each outlet’s ability to produce content.
	
	
	
	
The \emph{news shock} \(\bm{z}_d\) as defined in Eq. \ref{eq:efe},     is common to all outlets on a given day but affects them asymmetrically. Channels would like to produce at their steady-state, average positions (i.e., those depicted in Figure~\ref{fig:channel_ideology_lines}), but in the short run the available story mix constrains what they can cover. Since I assume daily content follows a random process and channels are aware of this, they smooth out variations in the news landscape by taking advantage of favorable days. The main identification assumption is that conditional on day fixed effects and controls, $\mathbf{z}_d$
shifts audience shares only through its effect on the cost of supplying slanted content (i.e., through $\mathbf{x_{jd}}$), not through direct shifts in viewers’ tastes.

Two examples illustrate the asymmetry. On {27 February 2023} (the highest $z_d^{L-}$ in the sample), a loophole in a law sponsored by UP led to early releases of convicted sexual offenders and corruption scandals hurt the Socialist Party. Airtime given to negative left-wing stories differed markedly across channels: A3 (right) devoted almost 19\%, TVE (left) and T5 each gave roughly 4\%, and La Sexta (left) about 2\%. The mirror image occurred on {17 May 2023} (the most negative day for right-wing parties): stories included a payments scandal involving the right-wing People’s Party, the defeat of a conservative motion in the Senate, and police-abuse allegations during a march against the extreme-right party VOX. Left-leaning outlets devoted about 15\% of airtime to negative right-wing content, whereas A3 devoted roughly 4\%. The full breakdown appears in Tables \ref{tab:neg_left_channels} and \ref{tab:neg_right_channels}.
	
 To show formal evidence of the previous mechanism, for each $(\text{party},\text{tone})$ pair I estimate separate regressions of the form:

%That there is exogenous variation across outlets is of practical importance for estimation and a necessary requirement that  the  rank condition requires for identification \citep{berry_haile_econometrica}. In order to show formal evidence of this variation,  I estimate, for each $(party,tone)$ pair, separate regressions of the form:
\begin{equation}\label{eq:first_stage}
	\begin{aligned}
		 x^{party, tone}_{jd} =	\sum_{k} \sum_{j'}
		\left(d_j(j') \times z^{k}_d\right)\,\alpha_{j}^{k}
		+ \epsilon_{jd},
	\end{aligned}
\end{equation}

where $k \in\{L+,R+,L-,R-, political\}$. As was described before,  $x^{party, tone}_{jd}$ is outlet $j$’s share of airtime with positive or negative tone about $party \in \{L,R\}$;  $z^{k}_d$ is the corresponding news shock from Eq. \ref{eq:efe}, and $d_j(j')$ is a dummy with value one if $j=j'$.  Controlling for the whole news landscape, I estimate how outlets increase the production of each type of content.
A positive coefficient $\alpha_{j}^{R+}$ means that, ceteris paribus, a 1 p.p. increase in  positive right-wing news shock increases outlet $j$’s coverage of the right by $\alpha_{j}^{R+}$ p.p.

 Figure \ref{fig:fwl} presents added-variable plots for regression Equation  \eqref{eq:first_stage} \footnote{I also present a non-linear LOWESS version to mitigate concerns of outliers in Appendix Figure \ref{fig:fwl_lowess}. Full results of the estimation are shown in Table \ref{tab:first_stage}.} pooling left channels for simplification.  When the share of  positive-right stories rises by one standard deviation, the right-leaning A3 lifts its own positive-right airtime by about 0.30 stdev., whereas the left-leaning outlets TVE and La Sexta react hardly at all.  Symmetrically, a one-stdev. increase in positive-left stories leads TVE to expand favorable coverage of the left by roughly 0.38 stdev, while A3’s response is not statistically different from zero.   By contrast, the adjustment on the negative right content is small. This is consistent with a saturation effect. Since all outlets already use negative tone on the right  (e.g., see Figure \ref{fig:chat}) this leaves them with less margin to adjust on this category.

		The existence of exogenous variation in outlets' response to the common news' shock is required by the rank condition \citep{berry_haile_econometrica} in the estimation.  Table \ref{tab:tests}   shows the F test for equality of coefficients across all outlets and the t-test for equality between right- and left-leaning outlets. The largest and most significant differences occur for pro-right content, followed by negative left, positive left and, the less significant negative right.

	Accordingly, I use
	$\bigl(z_d^{party+},z_d^{party-},z_d^{political}\bigr)_{party\in\{L,R\}}$
	as instruments for the linear content characteristics.  For the $K$ non-linear parameters governing preference heterogeneity I follow \citet{gandhi2019measuring} and use instruments of the form 
	$\bigl(\hat{x}_{jd}^k-\sum_{l\neq j}\hat{x}_{ld}^k\bigr)^2$,
	where $\hat{x}_{jd}^k$ is the predicted slant based on the reduced-form regression Eq. ~\eqref{eq:first_stage} constructed from the news shocks and outlet fixed effects. 	To identify demographic interactions, I multiply these instruments by the average share of right-wing votes, $\bar y_{mr}\,\hat{x}_{jd}^k$.



	\subsection{Results of the Demand Estimation}
	
	\label{sec:results}
	
	
I present the results of the BLP estimation for the off-campaign and campaign periods in Table \ref{tab:results_blp}. I show the preferred specification with both outlet and day-of-week fixed effects, and standard errors clustered at the regional level. Because the political division in demographics is only between left- and right-leaning viewers, the \(\beta\)s represent the mean tastes of left-leaning viewers and the \(\pi\)s are deviations for right-leaning audiences.


Most of the heterogeneity is captured by the demographics (i.e ideology).  The estimated taste-dispersion parameters (\(\sigma\)s) are small and very imprecise. The high standard errors on these coefficients arise by construction. The identification of the random-coefficients' standard deviations relies on variation across markets in the choice set, which is null in my case given that the same products are present across regions and dates. These low values of heterogeneity naturally link to the similar results that I obtain under the multinomial logit specification shown in Table \ref{tab:logit}. 
 
  In order to give a better interpretation of the content-taste parameters I present the mean own elasticities for both the off-campaign and campaign periods.   Given that increasing the positive relative minutes to a party also implies increasing the overall total minutes on politics, I compute the elasticity for the $k$-th characteristic as: 

%The pre-campaign estimates reveal four main facts. First, left-leaning audiences display a strong and precisely estimated mean taste for political stories (\(\beta^{political}>0\)). Second, left-wing viewers are pulled by negative tone on both blocs, with the effect much stronger and significant when the right bloc is the target (\(\beta^{R-}>0\)), while positive-toned stories are, on average, unattractive. Third, estimated taste-dispersion parameters (\(\sigma\)s) are small and very imprecise, which is unsurprising given that random-coefficient identification is weak when the set of products is fixed across markets \citep{berry_haile_econometrica}\footnote{These low values of heterogeneity naturally link to the similar results that I obtain under the plain logit specification shown in Table \ref{tab:logit}.}. Fourth, ideology–content interactions are generally noisy; the main signal is that right-leaning viewers place a lower value on generic political coverage than left-leaning viewers (\(\pi^{political}<0\)). 

%During the campaign window, the average taste of left audiences for political coverage turns negative (\(\beta^{political}<0\)), consistent with saturation once the race is underway. Framing now matters sharply: viewers reward positive stories about the left and negative stories about the right while penalizing the opposite frames, implying an aggregate tilt toward left-leaning parties (\(\beta^{L+}>0\), \(\beta^{R-}>0\), \(\beta^{R+}<0\), \(\beta^{L-}<0\)). Ideology interactions reveal marked polarization, with significant taste differences between right and left viewers. Right-leaning viewers now strongly seek favorable coverage of their own side and avoid negative stories about it (large opposing signs on \(\pi^{R+}\) and \(\pi^{R-}\)), dislike positive coverage of the left (\(\pi^{L+}<0\)), and demand negative coverage of the left (\(\pi^{L-}>0\)), indicating that out-group animosity is an important driver of viewing during the campaign.

	
%My results are consistent with \cite{Peterson2017Echo}, who found that partisans gravitate toward like-minded political content  during the 2016 U.S. presidential campaign.

	I present the results of the BLP estimation for the pre-campaign and campaign periods in Table \ref{tab:results_blp}. I show the preferred specification with outlet and day-of-week fixed effects and standard errors clustered at the regional level.
	
	The pre-campaign estimates reveal four main facts. First, there is a strong, statistically precise mean taste for stories about national politics in left audiences ($\beta^{political}$), indicating that political coverage per se draws audience attention before the campaign begins. Second, conditional on this baseline, viewers demand a negative tone toward both parties, but the pull is considerably stronger when the right-wing bloc is the target, whereas positive-toned stories are, on average, unattractive. Third, there is no sizable dispersion in the taste parameters captured by the estimated $\sigma$. This is expected, as identification of these parameters requires exogenous changes in the choice sets \citep{berry_haile_econometrica}, which do not apply in my market setup (i.e there are always the same amount of channels). Fourth, the ideology–content interaction terms are small and imprecise, so the heterogeneity cannot be explained by viewers’ ideology.
	
	During the campaign window, the same specification paints a markedly different picture. The average taste for political coverage becomes negative, suggesting that left audiences experience saturation once the race begins. Preferences reverse and intensify: viewers now reward positive stories about the left and negative stories about the right while penalising the opposite frames, producing an aggregate tilt toward left-leaning parties. Ideology–content interactions, however, reveal stark polarisation. Right-wing audiences actively seek favourable coverage of their own side and avoid negative stories about it, yet the dominant force is out-group animosity: they exhibit a particularly strong demand for negative coverage of the opposition. This pattern is consistent with \emph{affective polarisation} and echoes evidence from the United States showing that exposure to presidential campaigns makes partisans increasingly hostile toward their opponents \citep{Peterson2017Echo}.

	%\subsubsection{Elasticities}
	
	%I present the mean own elasticities for both the off-campaign and campaign periods.   Given that increasing the positive relative minutes to a party also implies increasing the overall total minutes on politics, I compute the elasticity for the $k$th characteristic as: 
	
	\begin{equation}\label{eq:elasticities}
		\begin{aligned}
			& \bar{\epsilon}^k= \frac{1}{J\times R \times D}\sum_{j}\sum_{r} \sum_{d} \left(\frac{\partial s_{jrd}}{\partial x_{jt}^k} +  \frac{\partial s_{jrd}}{\partial x_{jt}^{political}} \right) \frac{x_{jd}^k}{s_{jrd}}    \quad \forall k \in \{R+,R-,L+,L-\}
		\end{aligned}
	\end{equation}             
	
	
	
	Both left and right parties were almost equally disliked during off-campaign ( Table \ref{tab:elasticities0}.). An increase of 1 percent in net tone ($\bar{\epsilon}^{\text{party}+}-\bar{\epsilon}^{\text{party}-}$) towards right (left) results in drops of 0.98 (1.00) percentage points in audience share; corresponding to a decrease of nearly 13,000 viewers.\footnote{A 1 pp increase in airtime on characteristic $k$ changes audience share by $\Delta S = S \times \tfrac{\epsilon}{100}$. Given an average total audience of $\bar{L}$, the level change in viewers is $\Delta V = \Delta S \times \bar{L}$. Since 1 pp of airtime corresponds to $0.01\,\bar{T}$ minutes (where $\bar{T}$ is the average broadcast length), $\tfrac{\Delta V}{\Delta t} = \bigl(S \times \tfrac{\epsilon}{100} \times \bar{L}\bigr) \times \tfrac{1}{0.01\,\bar{T}}$ gives the change in viewers per extra minute of coverage.} This is consistent with a taste for scandals or entertainment-like type of political content, which is more likely to happen off-campaign. During the campaign, audiences remain averse to right-leaning tone—though less so, with only a 0.60 pp loss—but the effect of net left-leaning tone flips to 0.09 pp increase (867 viewers).
	
	
	To see the extent of polarization in news consumption, I  compute elasticities for right and left markets separately. I define a “right market” as any region whose mean intention-to-vote to the right  ($\bar{y}_r$) lies above the median. 
	
	 Figure~\ref{fig:elasticities_campaign} plots the estimated elasticities for the campaign\footnote{Table~\ref{tab:elasticities} and 	 Figure~\ref{fig:elasticities_pre} show full results also for the off-campaign period. } for left markets (panel a) and right markets (panel b).	Polarization becomes now evident. Left viewers present negative taste for content that harms their party and positive taste for content that benefits it. The analogous pattern is present in the taste of right-wing viewers. This campaign pattern contrasts with the off-campaign “scandal/negativity” taste, where both blocs reacted similarly to net partisan tone.

Content categories are negative-left, positive-right, negative-right, and positive-left coverage. Whiskers represent 95\% confidence intervals of the mean across markets..}
	 	
	 \end{figure}
	 
Furthermore, decomposing by party–tone shows that partisan reactions are asymmetric. In left markets, in-party affinity is relatively stronger (a larger reward for positive-left than for negative-right). In right markets, out-party aversion dominates (a larger penalty for positive-left and a stronger response to negative-right). For example, a 1 pp increase in negative-right tone during the campaign is associated with a net loss of 8,015 viewers in right markets relative to the off-campaign period. The consistent dislike is clear: both blocs screen out coverage that favors the opponent, and this out-party penalty is the dominant effect. 

	
	
	
	
	

	

	
%These results are consistent with \cite{Peterson2017Echo}, who found that partisans gravitate toward like-minded political content  during the 2016 U.S. presidential campaign. Specifically, by decomposing the different-party tone combinations, I also match the \textit{affective} type of polarization, where the negative taste towards favorable content on the opposition dominates.

	\subsection{Demand for News and Political Polarization}
	
	
Does polarization in media consumption link to electoral attitudes? I show correlational evidence between political and media polarization from my demand estimates. Following \citet{martin2017}, I compute an Esteban–Ray (ER) polarization index \citep{esteban}. Because the survey lacks a direct ideology item, I compute ER on \emph{party vote intentions} for the four main parties $\mathcal{P}=\{\mathrm{UP},\mathrm{PSOE},\mathrm{PP},\mathrm{VOX}\}$, renormalizing within $\mathcal{P}$ so that $\sum_{p\in\mathcal{P}} s_{prm}=1$ for region $r$ and month $m$. For $\alpha=1.5$, the ER index is

\begin{equation}
	ER_{rm} \;=\; 
	\displaystyle\sum_{p\in\mathcal{P}} \; \sum_{q\in\mathcal{P}} 
	s_{prm}^{\,1+\alpha}\, s_{qrm}\, d_{pq},
\end{equation}



where $d_{pq}$ denotes the normalized ideological distance between parties\footnote{Baseline ideology scores used to compute distances: $i_{\mathrm{UP}}=-1.0$, $i_{\mathrm{PSOE}}=-0.5$, $i_{\mathrm{PP}}=0.5$, $i_{\mathrm{VOX}}=1.0$. Distances are defined as $d_{pq}=\lvert i_p-i_q\rvert/\max_{i,j}\lvert i_i-i_j\rvert \in [0,1]$.}. The index $ER_{rm}$ is low when support concentrates on a single party and rises as mass is split across parties that are farther apart on the ideology scale.


	
	I measure  media polarization as the in-party vs. out-party gap in audience reactions to campaign coverage. Specifically, I calculate the \emph{elasticity gap} between reactions to congenial and uncongenial coverage during the campaign period. For right-wing regions, $p(r)=R$, media polarization refers to the difference in taste for negative content on the left versus positive on the right and analogously for left-wing regions:
	
	
	\begin{equation}
		MediaPolarization_r  =	\begin{cases}
			\bar{\epsilon}_r^{(L-)}- \bar{\epsilon}_r^{(L+)} \quad if \quad p(r)=R\\
			\bar{\epsilon}_r^{(R-)}- \bar{\epsilon}_r^{(R+)} \quad if \quad p(r)=L
		\end{cases}
		\label{eq:mediapol}
	\end{equation}
	
	Because the estimates satisfy
	\(\bar{\epsilon}_r^{(L-)}>\bar{\epsilon}_r^{(L+)}\) in right‑leaning regions and
	\(\bar{\epsilon}_r^{(R-)}>\bar{\epsilon}_r^{(R+)}\) in left‑leaning ones,
	the index in~\eqref{eq:mediapol} is always non‑negative and therefore comparable across regions. Larger values indicate that audiences penalize the out-party more (and/or reward it less) relative to the in-party, consistent with  in-out party evaluation gaps used to measure affective polarization  \citep{IyengarLelkesLevendusky2019Origins}. I divide regions into \textit{high} and \textit{low} groups according to their media polarization index relative to the median.  Results are shown in Figure \ref{fig:er1} for an extended period over the year before and after the 2023 election. 
	
	
	
	
	
	\begin{figure}[!htb]

		\centering
		\caption{Political Polarization by Level of Media Polarization}
		\includegraphics[width=150mm]{figures/er_polarization_stata_group_correct}
				\label{fig:er1}
		\caption*{\small  \textit{Note:} The figure shows the Esteban–Ray polarization index of vote intentions over time, plotted separately for regions with high versus low media polarization. High-polarization regions are those above the median in the media polarization index, defined as the difference between audience reactions to out-party versus in-party coverage during the campaign (Eq. \ref{eq:mediapol}). Vertical dashed lines marking the start of the campaign and election periods are shifted one month earlier to match the timing of the survey's timing.  The index is computed monthly using CIS intention-to-vote data aggregated by region. The series covers the year before and after the 2023 general election. All series have been smoothed under a three-month centered moving average.}
		
	\end{figure}
	
	
	
	
	Regions with high media‑consumption polarization (solid line) consistently show higher political polarization than their low‑polarization counterparts (dashed line)—a ranking that persists even when the series is extended one year before the main sample window. Similar  to  the demand‑side results, the political campaign constitutes a structural break of one year of declining polarization levels  that persists for over a year. This persistence contrasts with prior work that found short-lived effects of polarization after campaigns lose salience \citep{Hernndez2020AffectivePA}. Taken together, the figure provides strong correlational evidence between  media-consumption polarization and ideological polarization.

	% ols version under the wrong ER index

Does polarization in media consumption link to electoral attitudes? I show correlational evidence between political and media polarization from my demand estimates. As in \cite{martin2017}, I compute the Esteban–Ray (ER) polarization index \citep{esteban}. Unlike \cite{martin2017}, who apply ER to a distribution of individual ideology, survey data here lack an ideology item. I therefore compute ER on \emph{two-party vote intentions} collapsed into left versus right. Formally: 

\begin{equation}
	ER_{rm}  =	 \sum_{p}   \sum_{q}
	s_{prm}^{\,1+\alpha}\,s_{qrm} \times 1,
		\label{eq:er}
\end{equation}



where  $s_{pm}$ is the share intending to vote for party $p\in\{L,R\}$ in month $m$, and I set the standard $\alpha=1.5$. With only two blocs, I normalize their distance to one. Intuitively, higher values of the  index indicate that the electorate is split into two sizeable opposing camps. In this two-party setting, ER rises precisely when when  the gap between Left and Right narrows—and it falls when one side pulls further ahead. The index is therefore a  “catching-up” indicator: low when one party dominates, highest when the two blocs are evenly matched. 

%Note that, because inter-party distance is fixed here, ER captures the balance of support across blocs (how even the split is) rather than ideological distance between them.


%where $s_{pm}$ is the share of intention to vote for party $p\in \{L,R\}$  in month $m$ and I set the standard value $\alpha=1.5$. Since there are only two blocks, the distance between political parties is normalized to one.  Higher values of the index signal a sharper left‑right split in the electorate, i.e., greater political polarization.


I measure  media polarization as the in-party vs. out-party gap in audience reactions to campaign coverage. Specifically, I calculate the \emph{elasticity gap} between reactions to congenial and uncongenial coverage during the campaign period. For right-wing regions, $p(r)=R$, media polarization refers to the difference in taste for negative content on the left versus positive and vice versa: 


\begin{equation}
	MediaPolarization_r  =	\begin{cases}
		\bar{\epsilon}_r^{(L-)}- \bar{\epsilon}_r^{(L+)} \quad if \quad p(r)=R\\
		\bar{\epsilon}_r^{(R-)}- \bar{\epsilon}_r^{(R+)} \quad if \quad p(r)=L
	\end{cases}
		\label{eq:mediapol}
\end{equation}

Because the estimates satisfy
\(\bar{\epsilon}_r^{(L-)}>\bar{\epsilon}_r^{(L+)}\) in right‑leaning regions and
\(\bar{\epsilon}_r^{(R-)}>\bar{\epsilon}_r^{(R+)}\) in left‑leaning ones,
the index in~\eqref{eq:mediapol} is always non‑negative and therefore comparable across regions. Larger values indicate that audiences penalize the out-party more (and/or reward it less) relative to the in-party, consistent with  in-out party evaluation gaps used to measure affective polarization  \citep{IyengarLelkesLevendusky2019Origins}. I divide regions into \textit{high} and \textit{low} groups according to their media polarization index relative to the median. 



Figure \ref{fig:er1} plots the ER index for these two groups over the year before and after the 2023 general election. Regions with high media‑consumption polarization (solid line) consistently show higher political polarization than their low‑polarization counterparts (dashed line)—a ranking that persists even when the series is extended one year before the main sample window. Similar  to  the demand‑side results, political polarization starts to escalate at the campaign period.

High-polarization regions are those above the median in the media polarization index, defined as the difference between audience reactions to out-party versus in-party coverage during the campaign (Eq. \ref{eq:mediapol}). The index is computed monthly using CIS intention-to-vote data aggregated by region. The series covers the year before and after the 2023 general election. }
	
\end{figure}

Between April 2023 and the general election in July 2023, the Esteban–Ray index rises by 0.019 points in high-polarization regions and 0.012 points in low-polarization regions. When scaled by their respective pre-campaign variability, these changes correspond to 3.8 and 5.2 standard deviations, underscoring that the campaign coincided with an unusually abrupt increase in political polarization.




%Importantly, the trend break is concentrated in high media-polarization regions—those where news consumption was already most segregated—so the observed jump in ideological polarization is essentially generated by the “extreme partisan” audiences. This pattern resonates with studies showing that selective exposure amplifies attitudes among strong partisans \citep{levendusky}, but it diverges in duration from prior work on campaign dynamics. Whereas \citet{levendusky} finds short-lived effects following exposure, and \citet{Hernndez2020AffectivePA} show that campaign-induced polarization typically reverts to baseline shortly after elections, my evidence points to a persistent shift: polarization breaks trend at the campaign’s onset and remains elevated for at least a year. A natural interpretation is that campaigns re-sort media consumption among strong partisans (reinforcement), and that this effect persists beyond the campaign window, sustaining higher polarization even after campaign salience fades. 

\end{comment}



\paragraph{Limitations.}

To conclude the results section for demand, it is important to discuss some limitations of my analysis.

First, the use of aggregate data cannot rule out selection effects. Campaigns might change audience composition toward news seekers, who have been shown to have asymmetric effects on polarization relative to entertainment seekers \citep{levendusky,arceneaux_johnson_2013}. This could lead to an overestimation of preference polarization. 

Second, the link between media and political polarization naturally raises the question of how much of the shift in preferences is driven by changes in ideological polarization. I re-estimate the model in Equation~\ref{eq:utility} using initial ideology measures (i.e., December) rather than monthly ones; the results are robust. However, this does not mitigate the concern about the potential endogeneity of ideology, which remains a limitation of this paper. Future work might address this concern using individual panel data or by allowing more flexible dynamics between ideology and media consumption, as in \cite{martin2017}.

 



\section{Supply of News}


\label{sec:supply}








The demand estimates in Section~\ref{sec:results} show that viewers react sharply to
partisan tone, especially during the campaign.  This  leads to the complementary question:
How do broadcasters decide which mix of stories and tones to air each day? 
Spanish prime‑time newscasts are developed under tight time constraints, with producers
constantly monitoring real‑time ratings and the incoming news wire.  
The following remark from the news director of one of the channels captures this: 


\begin{quote}
	“Even a news program is deeply subject to the day-to-day swings of audience share.  
	A drop of half a point when covering a topic can lead us to drop that topic altogether.”
\end{quote}
\hspace*{\fill}–––Vicente Vallés, Director and Presenter, A3 News (2014)\footnote{Source: \url{https://cadenaser.com/ser/2014/12/03/television/1417630810_539829.html}}

Producers therefore aim to maximize the audience handed off to the next slot—despite the bulletin itself carrying no advertising—and fine‑tune slant before each edition.

\subsection{Supply Model}

I capture this behavior with a competitive model of news' slant decisions. Outlets choose the slant of their news editions to maximize total (national) audience, but face costs of producing the slant that depend on the news landscape available.  Formally, channel $j\in \{La \ Sexta, TVE, T5, A3\}$ \footnote{Although both La Sexta and A3 belong to the same media company, AtresMedia; the short period span considered here considers them as independent products. That is, firms and products coincide. } on day $d$ and edition hour $h\in\{0\text{ (midday)},1\text{ (evening)}\}$ solves the following problem:



\begin{equation}\label{eq:payoffs}
	\begin{aligned}
		\max_{\{\mathbf{x}_{jdh}\}}   & \left\{   \sum_{r}\widehat{\bm{s}_{jrd+1}}(\bm{x}_{jdh}, \bm{x}_{-jdh})\frac{L_r}{L} -  \mathcal{C}\left(  \bm{x}_{jdh},\bm{z}_{dh}, \bm{\eta}_{jd},\bm{\nu}_{jdh}; \bm{\lambda_j}   \right)    \right\}\\
		s.t.   \quad &   x_{jdh}^{L+} +x_{jdh}^{R+} + x_{jdh}^{L-} + x_{jdh}^{R-} + x_{jdh}^{\emptyset} = x_{jdh}^{political}\\
		& x_{jdh}^k \in [0,1] \quad \forall k
	\end{aligned}
\end{equation} 



where $\bm z_{dh}$ measures the pool of stories available at edition~$h$ and $\bm x_{jdh}$ is the proportion of minutes to each tone category as defined above. $L_r$  refers to the total potential audience in region $r$ and $L= \sum_r L_r$. I parameterize the cost function as:

\begin{equation*}\label{}
	\begin{aligned}
		& \mathcal{C}(x_{jdh}^k,z_{dh}^k,\eta_{jd}^k,\nu_{jdh}^k; \lambda_j^k )\equiv   \lambda_j^k  \dfrac{(x_{jdh}^k)^2}{z_{dh}^k} + F(\eta_{jd}^k,\nu_{jdh}^k,x_{jdh}^k).
	\end{aligned}
\end{equation*} 

 The $\bm{\lambda_j}$s are channel-specific  parameters that govern the slope of the production costs. The sign of~$\lambda_j^k$
 is theoretically ambiguous ex-ante. On the one hand, $z$ might act as a simple input in any production costs. High availability of stories of a given type will make production easier since the journalist need not make much effort to find them. This implies $ \lambda>0$. On the other hand, since outlets are news aggregators, having more stories available of a given type might increase production costs, since outlets would need to process and filter the stories they prefer. This mechanism is consistent under $ \lambda<0$. 
 
 
 There are unobserved (to the econometrician)  factors other than the stories available; captured by $ F(\eta_{jd}^k,\nu_{jdh}^k,x_{jdh}^k)$. The unobserved cost factors depend on two key components: i)
 $\eta_{jd}^k$, a \emph{ day-specific} marginal-cost shock
 (e.g.\ a key reporter is on sick leave, satellite link fails, or legal concerns delay a segment),
 and ii) $\nu_{jdh}^k$ is a mean zero channel-day-hour specific idiosyncratic supply shock. By assumption, these unobservables will enter as linear terms in the marginal costs. 
 



The first-order conditions (ignoring the  constraints for estimation) are
\begin{equation}\label{eq:focs}
	\underbrace{\sum_{r}\frac{\partial \widehat{s_{jrd+1}}}{\partial x_{jdh}^k}\frac{L_r}{L}}_{\equiv g_{jd+1}(x_{jdh}^k)}
	= 2\lambda_j^k\frac{x_{jdh}^k}{z_{dh}^k}  
	+\underbrace{\eta_{jd}^k+\nu_{jdh}^k}_{= F'(\cdot)}  
	\quad \forall(j,k)
\end{equation}



where, for notational simplicity, the derivative for all the tone characteristics also includes the marginal effect on $x^{political}$ but is omitted from the formulation. 



\subsection{Endogeneity and Identification Strategy}


Channels choose the day’s slant \(\mathbf{x}_{jdh}\) after observing the same-day cost shifter \(\eta_{jd}^k\). Events like a reporter's sick leave or a technical broadcast issue might shift these unobserved factors thus afecting the optimal slant \(\mathbf{x}_{jdh}\) and thereby the demand gradient \(g_{jd+1}(\mathbf{x}_{jdh})\). Formally, from Equation \ref{eq:focs}  $\E\left[\,F'(\cdot)\ \times \frac{x_{jdh}^k}{z_{dh}^k}\right]\neq 0$ .



%Because $\eta_{jd}^k$ influences both marginal cost and the share gradient
%$g_{jd+1h}^k$ would be biased in a naive regression: $\E[g_{jd+1h}^k\,\eta_{jd}^k]\neq0$.

The identification strategy exploits within-day timing. I assume that the day-specific cost shock \(\eta_{jd}^k\) is constant across editions (midday and evening), reflecting newsroom frictions that persist throughout the day. Under this assumption, changes in the chosen content mix between editions are driven by new stories coming between the midday and evening editions. These shifts move \(\bm x_{jdh}\) through the marginal cost term \(x_{jdh}^k / z_{dh}^k\) without affecting \(\eta_{jd}^k\), providing cost shifters that are orthogonal to the unobserved cost component.



%The key identification strategy lies in the assumption that $\eta_{jd}^k$ is constant within the day. This allows me to rely on variation in news production within the day that is only due to new stories coming in between the midday and evening editions that alter production.  

Text examples illustrate this mechanism (Table \ref{tab:within}). I filter the days with the highest within-day increase in coverage by all channels and report the new stories that entered between midday and evening editions for each content type. For instance, on 29 May 2023, stories criticizing the left pushed evening coverage sharply toward a pro-right tone; on 31 May 2023, stories criticizing the right swung coverage the opposite way. These sudden, within-day shifts in story mix create the variation used to estimate $\lambda$.




To document this variation, I first regress the evening on the midday slant of the stations controlling for outlet fixed-effects. The residuals of these regressions are the  variation in the evening programming not explained by the midday slant and channel-specific attributes. I then regress these residuals on the news shocks $z$ that enter between those two time slots. Figure \ref{fig:diff} shows the scatter of the regression.  There is a positive association for all content categories. This indicates that entry of new content between midday and night is associated with an increase in editorial production of that content in the evening news shows. \footnote{
	
	To decompose this variation by outlet, I also run regressions of the form described in  \ref{eq:first_stage} done on within-day differences $ \Delta x_{jd}$ and $\Delta z_{d}$. Figure \ref{fig:fwl_diff}  shows the added variable plots. Although there is significantly less power now, the main mechanism still holds. Right (left) outlets increase  their production of stories of a given party-tone from midday to the evening editions conditional on those stories being aligned with their stances. 
} 








Differencing~\eqref{eq:focs} eliminates the unobserved shock:

\begin{equation}\label{eq:diff_foc}
	\underbrace{%
		\sum_{r}\left(
		\frac{\partial \widehat{s_{jrd+1}}}{\partial x_{jd1}^k}
		-
		\frac{\partial \widehat{s_{jrd+1}}}{\partial x_{jd0}^k}
		\right)\frac{L_r}{L}
	}_{\textstyle \Delta g_{jd+1}^k}
	\;=\;
	2\lambda_j^k
\Delta	
 \frac{x_{jd}^k }{z_{d}^k }
	\;+\;
	\Delta\nu_{jd}^k,
	\quad \forall (j,k).
\end{equation}



Intuitively, the evening–midday change in the gradient, $\Delta g_{jd+1}^k$, is driven by the change in story availability $\Delta	
\frac{x_{jd}^k }{z_{d}^k }$, while the day-persistent cost shock cancels out. The system of equations in \ref{eq:focs} can be estimated under GMM with condition $\E \left[\Delta  \left( \frac{x_{jd}^k}{z_{d}^k} \right)  \Delta\nu_{jd}^k \right]= 0 $. 



\subsection{Results of the Supply Estimation}

\end{table}


%the heterogeneity in the estimated coefficients partly aligns with outlet's slant positions. Producing negative content on the left is costlier for all but the right wing channel. 




%The signs confirm the interpretation: left-favorable content is costlier for right-leaning outlets, and vice versa for all characteristics but  positive left content. It is important to remark that the interpretation of these cost parameters is broad and cannot be disentangled into different factors. Higher values of $\lambda$ could reflect costs in the production of certain content due to specialization of the journalists, having less access to information sources and/or private interests. 

The estimated cost slopes are heterogeneous across outlets and content types, and they partly line up with editorial positions. For instance, left outlets face higher costs for negative-left content, whereas the right-leaning channel does not. Producing content that favors the right 
is intrinsically beneficial across outlets ($\lambda<0$), but specially so for right channel. Negative-right content is beneficial or less costly for left outlets, while A3 faces the highest cost in that cell. The main deviation from this pattern is positive-left content, where signs match with the negative left one and thus do not reflect the expected asymmetries. 

The previous maximization problem might not be disciplined for some particular parameter values unless the usual optimality conditions are enforced. To assess this, Figure \ref{fig:payoffs} plots the implied payoff functions using the estimated demand and supply parameters.  The payoff functions are single-peaked or monotone, indicating that the observed choices satisfy the SOC/KKT conditions and correspond to maxima. The right-leaning outlet enjoys higher payoffs for producing positive-right content and negative-left content, whereas the left-leaning outlets obtain higher payoffs for negative-right content. The only inconsistency arises in the positive-left category, where the right-leaning outlet’s payoff is strictly increasing, this pattern reflects the cost parameters for this category reported in Table \ref{tab:costs}.






%\paragraph{Limitations}
%The supply estimation carries a number of limitations. First, broadcasting content nationally leaves days as the only source of independent variation to exploit, reducing sample size and statistical power. This is reflected in the very imprecise estimates in Table~\ref{tab:costs}. Second, parameterizing the cost function requires assumptions on functional form. The quadratic specification used here imposes marginal cost linear in $x$ and allows to exploit its within day variation for identification, but other functional forms could also be consistent with the competition game.



%Given the demand and supply estimates, in the next section I present the counterfactual analysis testing policy regulations on content.

\section{Proportional Air Time Rule}

\label{sec:counter}


Across Europe, the most common rule for election coverage is proportional airtime. France’s ARCOM times every political segment and enforces near  balance during the official campaign for both public and private broadcasters. Similarly, Germany or Italy's \textit{Par Condicio} tie lengths to past vote shares. Spain, by constrast, remains unregulated. 

My model estimates allow me to test what would be the  implications of enforcing such a policy for all broadcasters.  I take the proportion of votes in the past general elections for each party and estimate the new equilibrium under the following problem: 




\begin{equation}\label{eq:payoffs2}
	\begin{aligned}
		\max_{\{\bm{x}_{jd}\}}   & \left\{   \sum_{r}\widehat{s_{jrd+1}}(\bm{x}_{jd}, \bm{x}_{-jd})\frac{L_r}{L} - \sum_k \left({\hat{\lambda}_j^k}  \dfrac{(x_{jd}^k)^2}{z_{d}^k} + \hat{\eta}_{jd}^k x_{jd}^k \right)  \right\}\\
		s.t.   \quad &   \frac{x_{jd}^{R+} + x_{jd}^{R-} }{x_{jd}^{political}}=vote^R\equiv0.51\\
		&  \frac{x_{jd}^{L+} + x_{jd}^{L-} }{x_{jd}^{political}}= vote^L\equiv0.49\\
       &  x_{jd}^{L+} +x_{jd}^{R+} + x_{jd}^{L-} + x_{jd}^{R-} \leq  x_{jd}^{political}\\
		& x_{jd}^k \in (0,1] \quad \forall k
	\end{aligned}
\end{equation} 


where, in a logic consistent with my measurement strategy, time to a political party can only be discerned if that story has some specific slant. I assume that the policy is enforced; that is, all outlets must devote the proportion of political time given by vote shares from the previous election $(vote^R, vote^L)$ (i.e, constraints bind). This simplifies the choice set to $\left( x_{jd}^{L+} ,x_{jd}^{R+} ,x_{jd}^{political}\right)$. For computational constraints I i) pool left channels as a single player using their average payoffs and ii) discretize the action space and solve for the pure Nash equilibrium after converting the problem into a normal form game.\footnote{ In the original normal form game, the joint action space consists of 	$20^4=160,000$  pure strategy profiles under the simplest grid of 3 points per action. The counterfactual constraints simplify the action space to $4,096$ strategy profiles.  The code was run under a Google Cloud “n2d-standard-224” virtual machine (224 vCPUs, 896 GB RAM).} 

%Another important assumption in the counterfactual analysis relates to the unobserved marginal cost shifters $\eta$ in equation \ref{eq:focs}. Since the $\lambda$ parameters were estimating by first differencing and the small sample size does not leave enough degrees of freedom to estimate $\eta_{jd}^k$ as fixed effects, these terms are not included in the cost function in the counterfactual game in \ref{eq:payoffs2} (i.e I assume $\bm{\eta}= \bm{0}$).


From the  first-order condition in \eqref{eq:focs}, define the error

\[
r_{jdh}^k \;\equiv\; {{g}_{jd+1}} \;-\; 2\,{{\lambda}}_j^k\,\frac{x_{jdh}^k}{z_{dh}^k}
\;=\; \eta_{jd}^k + \nu_{jdh}^k .
\]


Under zero mean idiosyncratic noise, $\E(\nu_{jdh}^k)=0$, and unbiased estimate of the unobserved marginal cost shifter $\eta$ can be recovered by averaging across the midday and evening editions on the predicted residuals (i.e $\hat\eta_{jd}^k = \tfrac{1}{2}\big(\hat{r}_{jd0}^k+\hat{r}_{jd1}^k\big)$). In the counterfactual problem \eqref{eq:payoffs2} I treat $\hat\eta_{jd}^k$ as given (fixed by day and channel) and solve for best responses under the policy constraints, so changes arise from the policy, not from altering day-specific costs.

\subsection{Effects of the Regulation}

		``Counterfactual'' refers to predicted coverage choices obtained from solving the counterfactual optimization problem in Equation~\ref{eq:payoffs2}.     Channels are grouped by editorial slant: left-leaning (La~Sexta, TVE), middle (T5), and right-leaning (A3).}
\end{table}


Several facts emerge from the counterfactual exercise. First, left-leaning outlets (La Sexta/TVE) reduce the overall share of political coverage from 42\% to 30\% when constrained to allocate airtime proportionally. Since they are forced to spend more time on right-wing coverage, they cut back on politics altogether and shift tone toward a more negative tone of the right (from 0.09 to 0.15). At the same time, their positive coverage of the left remains broadly unchanged, implying that compliance is achieved primarily by eliminating right-positive content and compensating with hostile tone.


Second, the centrist outlet (T5) responds by dramatically expanding its political content, from 18\% of airtime in the factual data to 90\% in the counterfactual. This increase comes almost entirely in the form of negative tone: coverage harming the right grows more than tenfold (from 0.04 to 0.44), and coverage harming the left rises sharply as well (from 0.04 to 0.36). In other words, proportional airtime regulation induces T5 to turn heavily partisan, despite its relatively neutral baseline position.

Third, the right-leaning outlet (A3) also amplifies its use of negative tone. Its political coverage rises from 39\% to 90\%, with negative coverage of both left and right parties soaring (0.09 to 0.45 and 0.07 to 0.43, respectively). Positive coverage, by contrast, collapses to near zero.


Taken together, these adjustments generate a markedly more polarized landscape. Figure \ref{fig:change_line_counter} illustrates the resulting shifts in outlets’ ideological positions: left-leaning and centrist outlets move further left, while A3 strengthens its rightward tilt. Importantly, the regulation compresses the space for balanced coverage by forcing all outlets to increase political airtime but leaving tone unconstrained. Dispersion across channels increased from 0.06 to 0.20, with a notable rise in the standard deviation from 0.03 to 0.1, leading to a much more polarized media environment.


Evaluating demand at the counterfactual equilibrium shows that viewers become much more sensitive to net partisan tone, especially in ideologically aligned markets. Because outlets comply with proportional airtime mainly by raising negative coverage, marginal audience gains concentrate in those tone categories while positive tone loses traction. In right-leaning regions, a 1 pp increase in net right tone attracts on the order of 60,000 additional viewers (versus only a few thousand in the factual data); in left-leaning regions, the response to net left tone is several times larger than factually, around 80,000. By contrast, extra positive minutes yield little upside for the in-party and are punished more when they flatter the out-party. \footnote{Table \ref{tab:elasticities_count} shows the estimated elasticities for both the Factual and Counterfactual estimations. } Fixing airtime while leaving tone unconstrained therefore makes small shifts in tone move audiences at scale, strengthening incentives to go negative and amplifying affective polarization on the demand side.


Finally, the counterfactual results should be interpreted with caution. First, I discretize each outlet’s action space on a coarse grid; best responses can be pushed to grid boundaries, yielding corner solutions that may over- or understate the continuous-choice equilibrium. Second, I retain only equilibria for which a unique pure-strategy Nash equilibrium is found. This excludes realizations with multiple (or mixed-strategy) equilibria and may bias inference toward stability; if multiplicity matters, equilibrium selection could depend on unmodeled factors. Third, for tractability I pool La Sexta and TVE into a single left player with averaged payoffs. This removes within-bloc competition and coordination frictions; in the full four-player game left outlets might either undercut one another on tone or differentiate strategically, altering the comparative statics. Relaxing either assumption could dampen or reshape the effects.



	
	\section{Conclusion}
	\label{sec:conclusion}
	
	



This paper studies how election campaigns reshape demand for political news using a structural model of television news supply and demand. I construct a story-level slant index for prime-time broadcasts by combining machine learning with large language models (LLMs), and match it to high-frequency audience data. This design links content to viewership in a single equilibrium framework, allowing me to observe both viewers’ choices and outlets’ strategic editorial responses.


I apply the framework to Spain’s 2023 general election. On the demand side, I estimate a BLP-style random-coefficients model identified by exogenous day-to-day shifts in the newswire mix that change the set of stories available to outlets without directly altering preferences. The results show that political news consumption polarizes sharply during the campaign, in the form of affective polarization: in right-leaning regions, additional positive coverage of right-wing parties is associated with higher viewership, whereas more negative-right tone is associated with losses; left-leaning regions display symmetric responses. Polarization in media demand is closely linked to political polarization: regions with stronger campaign-period polarization in news demand exhibit higher ideological polarization, which remains elevated for over a year.


Building on the demand and supply estimates, I evaluate the most common regulatory measure in TV markets during campaigns: proportional-airtime rules. The simulations indicate that, while such rules succeed in balancing exposure across parties, they amplify polarization in slant. The mechanism is tone substitution: when minutes are equalized, outlets comply on exposure but shift sentiment, widening cross-outlet dispersion in supplied slant and strengthening audience responses to partisan content.


This paper underscores two main points. First, surges in polarization during periods of intense political conflict are closely mirrored by shifts in media consumption. Second, widely used metrics for monitoring media bias—such as airtime balance—often overlook crucial differences in political tone, leading to interventions and regulations with unintended consequences. When policy is designed using incomplete or misaligned measures, regulation can inadvertently amplify polarization along dimensions it fails to capture, such as editorial slant. The methodological framework developed here provides a more robust basis for media monitoring and a path for evaluating regulatory measures that more effectively reduce polarization across media landscapes.


Several avenues for future research emerge from the present work. Leveraging the unique feature of the dataset—which matches stories across outlets on a daily basis—future work could micro-found editorial decisions about story choices from the underlying news landscape to distinguish between different forms of bias, such as selection, and framing, as theorized in previous works \citep[e.g.][]{gentzkow2014media}. Another direction would be to extend the estimation framework to multi-dimensional ideological spaces and dynamic models of media consumption and supply, incorporating feedback between ideology and media consumption to test the extent of media persuasion.

\section{Data Pipeline  Details}\label{sec:appendix_models}



This appendix describes the end-to-end pipeline used to collect, process, and analyze Spanish prime-time newscasts. The workflow follows  Figure~\ref{fig:pipeline}: daily recordings are stored, audio is extracted and transcribed, text is segmented into minute-level stories, topics are estimated with a topic model, and political tone is classified with a large language model. The corpus comprises the midday and evening national newscasts of TVE, A3, La~Sexta, and T5, totaling {563 hours} of programming stored and versioned in Google Cloud Storage (GCS) \footnote{This project has been supported by Google Cloud for Education credits and OpenAI research credits.} %with a total value spent of 5,747 and 2,245 euros, respectively. }






\begin{figure}[!htb]

	\caption{Pipeline for Content Downloading and Classification }
	\includegraphics[width=150mm]{figures/pipeline3}
	\caption*{\small \textit{Note:} Pipeline for the text downloading. First videos are downloaded daily from the main TV channels. Google engine is used to convert the audio to text. I then split the stories by minute and use BERTopic to classify and match them. Finally, ChatGPT4 is used to classify political tone.}
	\label{fig:pipeline}
\end{figure}



\textbf{Audio and transcription.} Each broadcast is converted from MP4 to mono PCM WAV to standardize the input for automatic speech recognition. Transcripts are obtained with \emph{Google Cloud Speech-to-Text} (language \texttt{es-ES}, long-running recognition with automatic punctuation). The service returns time-stamped transcripts; for each show I archive the raw JSON and a lightly normalized plaintext transcript.

\textbf{Segmentation and alignment.} Newscasts are split into minute-level stories using program timestamps and textual cues (anchor transitions and title cards). 

\textbf{Topic discovery.} Topics are estimated with \emph{BERTopic} using multilingual sentence embeddings (\texttt{paraphrase-multilingual-MiniLM-L12-v2}). After fitting, outlier reduction and topic updates are applied; residual or incoherent clusters are flagged and excluded from matched comparisons.

\textbf{ChatGPT ideology classification.} Story-level political tone is obtained with ChatGPT on a discrete grid per party. To reduce computational and monetary costs, I first filter the set of minute-level stories using a dictionary of political keywords (Table~\ref{table:politics}); the final classification set contains 15{,}406 stories. The prompt used in the classifier is:

\begin{tcolorbox}[colback=blue!5!white, colframe=blue!75!black, title=Prompt]
	Analyze the sentiment of the following news article with respect to the political parties (and their members) in Spain: PP, Podemos/Sumar, PSOE, VOX. Only use numeric values from the set [-1, -0.5, 0, 0.5, 1].
	
	Evaluate the sentiment towards each party with a number between -1 and 1, where -1 indicates an extremely negative perception, 0 indicates neutrality or irrelevance for the party, and 1 indicates an extremely positive perception.
	
	Consider only the values -1, -0.5, 0, 0.5, and 1.
	
	Base your evaluation solely on the explicit content of the news article. If the article does not mention or imply any sentiment towards a party, assign a 0 to that party.
	
	The format must always be a list \texttt{[PP
		, PSOE
		, UP
		, VOX
		]} where \texttt{X} represents the numeric sentiment value.
\end{tcolorbox}

\noindent\textit{Note:} Prompt used under \textit{gpt-4-0125-preview}. Story-level tones are aggregated to the program–day level with duration weights (seconds per story). Channel-level summaries are constructed by averaging across program–days, and matched-story comparisons are restricted to aligned topic–day pairs.

\section{Robustness of the Text Classification}

\label{sec:robustness}







\subsection{Comparison with Previous Approaches}


One concern with LLMs classification is whether they can consistently capture meaningful patterns in text to distinguish tone. Table \ref{tab:top_trigrams} shows the most frequent three-word sequences across each sentiment–ideology category. The trigrams in the “Positive Right” column center on leadership titles and formal roles, reflecting an organizational focus; those in “Negative Right” cluster around legal and procedural language, indicating contexts of investigation or trial. The “Positive Left” trigrams emphasize policy areas and sectoral initiatives, suggesting substantive, topic-driven framing, while the “Negative Left” sequences feature judicial and procedural terms, pointing to oversight and legal scrutiny. Specific examples of stories can be seen in Appendix Table \ref{tab:examples_stories}.


To assess robustness, I also compare the LLM’s classifications with those obtained using methods from previous works \citep{gentzkow2010media,laver2003extracting}. I use all Spanish congress speeches during my sample period and exploit party labels to assess similarities with the outlets’ content. 


Similar to \cite{gentzkow2010media} and \cite{laver2003extracting} I exploit party ideology in congress speeches to calculate similarity measures of the outlet's speech. I make use of all congressional speeches produced during my sample period and associate each speaker with their respective political party, filtering to retain the set of relevant parties.

I follow a similar, non-linear version of \cite{laver2003extracting} and create a score for each word $w$ in the congress speech as: 



\begin{equation}
	\text{Score}(w) \;=\; \ln \left( \frac{\mathrm{freq}(w,\text{Left}) + \alpha}{\mathrm{Total}_{\text{Left}} + \alpha} \right) \;-\; \ln \left( \frac{\mathrm{freq}(w,\text{Right}) + \alpha}{\mathrm{Total}_{\text{Right}} + \alpha} \right),
	\label{eq:log_ratio}
\end{equation}

where:
\begin{itemize}
	\item $\mathrm{freq}(w,\text{Left})$ is the number of times word $w$ appears in the speeches of left-leaning parties (PSOE and UP),
	\item $\mathrm{Total}_{\text{Left}}$ is the total word count in left-party speeches,
	\item $\mathrm{freq}(w,\text{Right})$ and $\mathrm{Total}_{\text{Right}}$ are defined analogously for right-leaning parties (PP and Vox), and
	\item $\alpha$ is a small smoothing parameter.
	
\end{itemize}

I select the value of alpha that maximizes accuracy of label prediction in the congress dataset; $\alpha=0.9$.	
Words with high positive scores are used disproportionately in left-leaning speeches, while those with high negative scores are more characteristic of right-leaning speeches. I rank all words by their computed score and select the top 100 left-coded words and top 100 right-coded words, represented in  Figure  \ref{fig:wordcloud}.

	\label{fig:wordcloud}	
\end{figure}



The word clouds make clear the distinctive use of language by parties in congress. On the left, for example, the large term “neoliberal” (neoliberalism) underscores an ongoing critique of market‐driven reforms, while “oligopolio” (oligopoly) highlights concerns about concentrated economic power. On the right, “sanchismo” (literally “Sánchez-ism”) signals frequent reference to the governing style of Prime Minister Sánchez as a political brand, and “pederastas” (pederasts) reveals the use of morally charged scandal language with the ley solo sí es si scandal. 





Figure \ref{fig:congress_line} shows the left–right positions derived from this method. Although the overall ranking of the outlets from left to right is consistent with the ChatGPT classification in Figure \ref{fig:chat}, the middle channel is now classified as left-wing, close to the public channel.

	\label{fig:congress_line}
\end{figure}




Two remarks are worth mentioning. First, it is important to note that this comparison against survey data might entail some issues. Declared preferences can serve as validation under the assumption of channels' decisions being heavily driven by demand preferences rather than other factors. Cross-validation of human annotators on the labels of political stories would be an alternative way to check out the results. 

Second, reducing each story to a single left–right score aids interpretation, but ignores the multidimensional nature of politics highlighted by \citet{puglisi2011newspapers}. Economic versus cultural cleavages, or regional versus national frames, may evolve differently and deserve separate tracking. I leave extending the LLM classifier to a low-dimensional vector of ideological dimensions for future work.




\subsection{Stability of the Classifier}


Due to their inherent stochasticity, repeated queries using the same prompt may yield different classifications \citep{llmstability2024}. As shown in \citep{llmclassification2024}, this variability can introduce noise in tasks that require high consistency, particularly in content classification. To mitigate this issue, I leverage OpenAI’s “functions” tool, which constrains the classifier’s responses to predefined discrete numerical outputs, reducing potential inconsistencies. Table \ref{tab:table_stability} presents the mean classification scores from 100 iterations of a random sample of political stories \footnote{Good practices recommend to run the classification multiple times and average out the results \citep{tornberg2023}. Financial costs, however, impede me from doing the whole approach multiple times}, along with the corresponding standard errors. The relatively small standard errors suggest that, despite the model’s stochastic nature, the classification remains stable.

	\end{tabular}
	\caption*{\small \textit{Note:}  The table shows the mean and standard error for 100 rounds of ChatGPT classification of political content with 40 random political stories.}
	\label{tab:table_stability}
\end{table}









\subsection{Text vs.\ Image}




Imagery is a key component of television. This may be especially relevant for political actors, for whom televised coverage has been shown to magnify the impact of candidates’ physical appearance on voter perceptions and electoral outcomes \citep{Lenz2011LookingTP}. Imagery in the form of time devoted to candidates further constitutes the main metric used by regulatory agencies. For example, the French media authority ARCOM publishes monthly “pluralism” reports that track each political actor’s share of speaking time on national television; Italy’s Osservatorio di Pavia produces similar statistics for the national regulator AGCOM. These metrics have also been used extensively in research as measures of slant \citep[see, e.g.,][]{CageHengelHerveUrvoy2022,durante2012partisan}.

Here I compare some of these approaches to my text-based measure. Due to computational constraints, I cannot perform image detection across my full video sample. Instead, I compare image-based and text-based metrics using a random sample of 67 days. Specifically, I train a state-of-the-art face recognition system \citep{face_recognition} using labeled images of the main party leaders: Pedro Sánchez (PSOE), Alberto Núñez Feijóo (PP), Santiago Abascal (VOX), and Yolanda Díaz (UP). I then extract frames from the first 25 minutes of each prime-time news broadcast across major channels, resulting in a sample of 79,788 images. Using the \texttt{face\_recognition} library, I detect and identify faces in each frame. This allows me to construct a frame-level dataset of visual exposure, which I aggregate at the daily level for each channel and party leader.

The net tone on the sample of days for each channel and political leader is shown in Figure 	\ref{fig:tone_channel}. As expected, significant differences appear, positioning channels in the left-right spectrum shown before. 


\begin{figure}[htbp!]
	\caption{Net Tone per Channel and Politician}
	\centering
	\includegraphics[width=150mm]{figures/politicians_tone_proportions}
	\caption*{\small \textit{Note:} The figure shows the net tone based on the ChatGPT classification by political actor and channel for a random sample of 67 days. }
	\label{fig:tone_channel}
\end{figure}





Next, I compare if visuals or tone follow a similar scenario. Figure \ref{fig:combined_channel} panel a) shows the proportion of image appearances by channel and political leader. All channels coincide in their ranking, giving more air to PP, followed by PSOE, UP, and VOX. The two most extreme channels—La Sexta on the left and A3 on the right—give very similar coverage to the right-wing politician Feijóo, appearing in nearly 2\% of the frames. Panel b)  reveals a similar pattern for text mentions of the party leaders.

\caption*{\small
		\textit{Note:} The proportions are computed per channel and political actor over the same random sample of 67 days.}
	\label{fig:combined_channel}
\end{figure}



To further examine the relationship between tone—based on the LLM classification—and coverage, I regress net tone by political actor on both the proportion of image appearances and word mentions. Table \ref{tab:images2} reports results under different specifications, including date and channel fixed effects.

\end{table}



Column~(4) reports the specification with both channel and day of the week fixed effects, so the coefficients reflect pure within–channel–day fluctuations in coverage. The pattern is heterogeneous across politicians. For Abascal (VOX), a one-standard-deviation increase in word mentions predicts a decrease of $0.39$ standard deviations in tone, whereas the same increase in on-screen images predicts an increase of $0.06$ standard deviations. Both left-leaning politicians present positive correlations between image appearances and tone, although neither appears to be a strong predictor.

Taken together, the results indicate that text-based and image-based measures of salience relate to tone in systematically different ways. Outlets appear much more homogeneous under this metric, with extreme channels showing similar values. This poses concerns regarding the interpretation of previous metrics based on airtime.

\section{Isolation Index }
\label{sec:isolation}

\subsection{Defnition}

For a medium $m\in \{TV,Radio,Press\}$, the isolation index is computed as:


\begin{equation}\label{eq:isolation}
	\begin{aligned}
		& \mathrm{Isolation}_m=%
		\sum_{j}
		\Bigl(\tfrac{\mathrm{Right}_j}{\mathrm{Right_m}}\Bigr)
		\Bigl(\tfrac{\mathrm{Right}_j}{\mathrm{Audience}_j}\Bigr)
		-
		\sum_{j}
		\Bigl(\tfrac{\mathrm{Left}_j}{\mathrm{Left_m}}\Bigr)
		\Bigl(\tfrac{\mathrm{Right}_j}{\mathrm{Audience}_j}\Bigr),
	\end{aligned}
\end{equation} 


%
where $\mathrm{Right}_j$ and $\mathrm{Left}_j$ denote the numbers of right- and left-leaning viewers of outlet $j$, $\text{Audience}_j=Right_j + Left_j$ is its total audience of that outlet and $R_m$ are the total right-wing viewers in that medium. 

The isolation index takes value of 1 iff, for every outlet that right people visit ($Right_j>0$), then all other visitors are also right-wing, $\frac{Right_j}{Audience_j}=1$ and the analogous for outlets consumed by left-wing users. This reflects an scenario of perfect segregation.

\section{Chat GPT Ideology Classification}\label{sec:chat_gpt}
	
	In this section I summarize the usage of ChatGPT as a text classifier for political tone. I detail the prompt and specification details used for the text classification together with final results. 
	
	The prompt used in the classifier is: 
	
	
	\begin{tcolorbox}[colback=blue!5!white, colframe=blue!75!black, title=Prompt]
		Analyze the sentiment of the following news article with respect to the political parties (and their members) in Spain: PP, Podemos/Sumar, PSOE, VOX. Only use numeric values from the set [-1, -0.5, 0, 0.5, 1].
		
		Evaluate the sentiment towards each party with a number between -1 and 1, where -1 indicates an extremely negative perception, 0 indicates neutrality or irrelevance for the party, and 1 indicates an extremely positive perception.
		
		Consider only the values -1, -0.5, 0, 0.5, and 1.
		
		Base your evaluation solely on the explicit content of the news article. If the article does not mention or imply any sentiment towards a party, assign a 0 to that party.
		
		The format must always be a list \texttt{[PP
			, PSOE
			, UP
			, VOX
			]} where \texttt{X} represents the numeric sentiment value.
		
		
	\end{tcolorbox}
	Note: 	Prompt used under \textit{gpt-4-0125-preview}.
	
	
	
	
	To reduce both computational and monetary costs, I first filter our split stories using a simple dictionary based approach into those that might contain any relevant political information. Table \ref{table:politics} shows the key terms used to filter the political stories. After the match, I obtain a final number of 15406 political stories that I feed into the chat GPT classifier.

	\subsection{Alternative methods for segment splitting in unstructured text}
	
	I explain here different unsupervised text splitting methods that were tried to split the segments of the day. To the best of my knowledge, these methods have not been applied before and can be easily extended to any TV news set up. The advantage of these techniques is that they provide an unsupervised way to split unstructured text into stories that is precise up to the second level, thus overcoming the problem of the manually annotated labels which goes at the minute level. There is, however, computational or financial costs in some of them that impeded me to use them for the whole dataset.
	
	\textbf{Image recognition}
	
	Outlets typically segment their sections by means of captions where they introduce headers for the upcoming story. Exploiting our video dataset, I designed an unsupervised image recognition algorithm that tracks the appearance of those new segments and produces a set of times that serve as text splitters. Although precise, the disadvantage of this method is that it remains computationally intensive as videos need to be segmented and then processed into the algorithm. Computational cost can be reduced by focusing on the lower bottom of the screen  only (figure \ref{figure:image_rec}), which is the area where the output is expected to appear.
	
	\begin{figure}[H]

		\caption{Example of  image story delimiter}
		\includegraphics[width=100mm]{figures/image_recog}
		
		\caption*{\small Notes: Example of a image with a caption that delimits the beginning of a new section. The highlighted area shows the bottom of the image where image recognition can be applied to find such appearances.}
			\label{figure:image_rec}
	\end{figure} 
	
	
	
	
	\textbf{Speaker diarization}
	
	
	A less computationally expensive alternative consist on using \textit{speaker diarization} on the wav files. After transforming the mp4 file to audio using \textit{ffmpeg}, I use Google Cloud diarization tool to find the different speakers in an audio file. The most common (or most two common if it is a weekend) speakers overall corresponds to the presenter of the news. After allowing a flexible specification, one can identify break points by cheeking the seconds where the presenter comes back into scene making sure she is speaking long enough so that a new segment is being introduced. Figure \ref{fig:diarization} illustrates this procedure and the comparison with the manually annotated labels for an example day-channel.
	
	
	\begin{figure}[H]

		\caption{Comparison audio splitting with annotated section splits}
		\includegraphics[width=120mm]{figures/speakers_all}
		\includegraphics[width=120mm]{figures/speaker_timeline}
		\caption*{\small Notes: The top figure shows the timeline for the presenter audio (red) vs other audios recognized by \textit{speech2text} in a wav file for the 15th January 2023 in La Sexta. Vertical, black, dashed lines represent the predicted splits based on the diarization. The bottom figure combines these splits with the ones that come from the manually annotated figures. Red, dashed bars correspond to the breaks that come from the manually annotated GECA dataset. Green bars represent breaks where both the speaker diarization and the manual annotation coincide on a break. }
